Article title:  〈美股早盤〉市場尋求降息的進一步線索 主要指數走勢偏弱 費半仍漲

Article maintext:  美股周一 (4 日) 早盤多呈現下跌，道瓊指數下跌 0.45%，標普 500 指數下跌 0.12%，那斯達克指數下跌 0.13%，費半上漲 0.54%，台積電 ADR 持續強漲。
美股標普指數上周五升至歷史新高，主要由科技股帶動，而消費者信心和製造業活動疲軟的跡象，也增強了聯準會將在今年稍早降息的預期。
標普 500 指數上周五上漲 0.8%，收在創紀錄的 5137.08 點。 以科技股為主的那斯達克指數上漲 1.1%，至 16274.94 點，道瓊指數上漲 0.2%，至 39087.38 點。
本周的焦點完全集中在聯準會主席鮑爾周三在眾議院委員會和周四參議院小組上的證詞。鮑威爾預計將在很大程度上重申聯準會的立場，即面對黏性通膨，利率應保持穩定—這一觀點在過去兩周得到了聯準會幾位官員的回應。
儘管如此，投資人仍將尋找今年首次可能降息時間的線索，市場目前預計聯準會將在 6 月開始降低借貸成本。
另一方面，比特幣突破了 65000 美元，交易員押注該加密貨幣將超越疫情期間創下的近 69000 美元的歷史新高。
截至台北時間周一 22 時許：
道瓊指數下跌 174.08 點或 0.45%，暫報 38913.30 點
那斯達克下跌 20.91 點或 0.13%，暫報 16254.03 點
標普 500 下跌 6.31 點或 0.12%，暫報 5130.77 點
費半上漲 26.68 點或 0.54%，暫報 4956.27 點
台積電 ADR 上漲 4.89% 至每股 140.45 美元
十年期美債殖利率上漲 2 個基點，至 4.20%
紐約輕原油下跌 0.14%，至每桶 79.86 美元
布蘭特原油上漲 0.05%，至每桶 83.59 美元
黃金上漲 0.35%，至每盎司 2090.34 美元
美元指數上漲 0.05%，至 103.91
焦點個股：
蘋果 (AAPL-US) 下跌 1.78%，至 176.46 美元
歐盟執行機構歐盟執委會周一 (4 日) 對蘋果處以 18 億歐元 (19.5 億美元) 反壟斷罰款，因為蘋果濫用其在音樂串流應用程式分發市場的主導地位。
執委會表示，它發現蘋果對應用程式開發者施加限制，阻止他們向 iOS 用戶告知應用程式之外提供的替代且更便宜的音樂訂閱服務。
委員會指出，蘋果還禁止音樂串流應用程式開發人員提供有關用戶如何訂閱這些更便宜優惠的任何說明。
梅西百貨 (M-US) 上漲 16.77%，至 21.03 美元
專注房地產的投資公司 Arkhouse Management 周日 (3 日) 表示，它和 Brigade Capital Management 已提高對梅西百貨的收購報價。該百貨連鎖店之前以價格太低為由拒絕了先前的提議。
這些公司現在提出以每股 24 美元的價格收購尚未持有的梅西百貨股票，比之前每股 21 美元的報價高出約 14%。
捷藍航空 (JBLU-US) 上漲 3.93，至 6.72 美元
捷藍航空和精神航空 (Spirit Airlines)(SAVE-US) 周一 (4 日) 表示，在質疑該交易的聯邦反壟斷訴訟敗訴幾周後，雙方將終止合併協議。
去年司法部起訴禁止捷藍航空收購廉價航空公司 Spirit 後，一名聯邦法官於 1 月阻止該交易。司法部聲稱此次收購將抑制航空業的競爭，並消除精神航空作為對價格敏感的旅客的折扣替代品的機會。
華爾街分析：
Jefferies 策略師 Mohit Kumar 發布報告指出，經濟展望走強、投資者看漲，還有部分業績改善，支撐了股票市場，「不論是經濟前景，還是再次出現央行政策托市的可能，投資者對於風險資產都非常樂觀。」
高盛集團策略師表示，在少數幾支極為強勁的科技股推動下，標普 500 指數創出紀錄高點，此番走勢與過去的股市泡沫並不相同，「這一次不一樣」。
高盛策略師 David Kostin 在 3 月 1 日的報告中稱，企業估值 / 銷售比率超過 10 倍的股票占美國股市總市值的 24%，而 2021 年這一比例為 28%，科技股泡沫期間為 35%。然而，「極端估值」的廣度要有限地多，在上述倍數交易的股票數量遠低於 2021 年的峰值。

Article title:  Nvidia desponta como sucessora da Tesla em NY, mas queda de ação de Musk traz lições

Article maintext:  As ações da Tesla caíram mais de 50% do pico alcançado em 2021, e outros papéis de empresas de veículos elétricos que subiram junto com ela são sombras de do que já foram
Publicidade
Bloomberg — A impressionante ascensão da Nvidia continua a cativar investidores e analistas do mercado de ações e a impulsionar o S&P 500 para novas máximas. Mas também levanta lembretes cautelosos de outro queridinho dos investidores que, não faz muito tempo, decolou com sonhos de uma transformação tecnológica, apenas para cair de volta à realidade quando essas esperanças se transformaram em decepção.
A Tesla suscitou sua própria febre compradora em 2017, à medida que os investidores apostavam que os veículos elétricos iriam dominar o mundo. Na época, a empresa de Elon Musk era um fenômeno, ultrapassando montadoras estabelecidas como General Motors e Ford em capitalização de mercado para se tornar a maior fabricante de automóveis dos Estados Unidos. Alguns analistas olhavam além dessa indústria e a chamavam de “a próxima Apple.” Esses dias já são passado.
As ações da Tesla caíram mais de 50% do pico alcançado em 2021, e outros papéis de empresas de veículos elétricos que subiram junto com ela são sombras de do que já foram. Tudo isso deve ser um alerta para os investidores da Nvidia que veem a ação como uma aposta ilimitada no futuro da IA. “Vimos repetidamente que, quando os investidores se apaixonam pela ideia da inovação tecnológica do momento, a lógica é deixada de lado”, disse Adam Sarhan, fundador e CEO da 50 Park Investments, em entrevista à Bloomberg News. “E, quando a emoção assume, o céu é o limite.”

Diferenças e semelhanças
Claro, existem muitas diferenças entre a Nvidia e a Tesla, desde os produtos que elas fabricam até a personalidade dos homens que comandam as empresas. Mas as semelhanças são impressionantes.
A ascensão da Nvidia, de fabricante de chips de nicho para uma das maiores empresas do mundo, é baseada na premissa de que seu crescimento fenomenal de vendas nos últimos anos tem poder duradouro. O grande rali de sucesso da Tesla, por sua vez, que ocorreu em 2020 e colocou seu valor de mercado em mais de US$ 1,2 trilhão, foi baseado na suposição de que os veículos elétricos seriam amplamente e rapidamente adotados, e que a empresa seria a dominante nesse mercado. No entanto a realidade interrompeu essa história.
A demanda por veículos elétricos desacelera à medida que a onda de primeiros adotantes entusiastas já passou, e os consumidores mais conscientes do preço e céticos sobre grandes mudanças estão demorando mais do que o esperado para aderir a uma nova tecnologia. Como resultado, a ação da Tesla caiu 31% em relação ao seu pico recente em julho passado e tem sido uma das maiores quedas em termos percentuais no índice Nasdaq 100 neste ano.
“Todo esse potencial sobre o carro autônomo, a Cybertruck e a ação está sendo prejudicado. Por quê? Eles [a Tesla] estão perdendo participação de mercado e margens. No mundo da tecnologia, isso é o ‘beijo da morte’”, disse Sameer Bhasin, da Value Point Capital.
Para a Nvidia, é cedo demais no ciclo de hype para vislumbrar qualquer sinal de desaceleração. A empresa com sede em Santa Clara, na Califórnia, entregou resultados impressionantes por quatro trimestres consecutivos, impulsionados pelo que parece ser uma demanda insaciável por seus chips usados para treinar modelos de linguagem que alimentam aplicativos de IA como o ChatGPT da OpenAI.
Após mais que triplicar de valor no ano passado, a ação da Nvidia, em 2024, tem novamente o melhor desempenho do índice S&P 500, com um avanço de 66% até aqui. Seu valor de mercado de mais de US$ 2 trilhões fica atrás apenas de duas empresas dos EUA: Apple (AAPL) e Microsoft.
A discussão sobre o uso generalizado da IA em diversas indústrias e empresas lembra a empolgação em torno da internet e os anos que antecederam a bolha das empresas “ponto-com no fim dos anos 1990.
Mas, diferentemente dessa época, em que as empresas de internet estavam sendo valorizadas com base em novas métricas como “cliques” enquanto perdiam (muito) dinheiro, a Nvidia tem gerado enormes lucros.
O lucro líquido aumentou mais de 500%, para quase US$ 30 bilhões, no ano passado. E espera-se que dobre no ano atual, segundo dados compilados pela Bloomberg. Riscos adjacentes Esses grandes lucros e a capacidade da empresa de superar constantemente as estimativas ajudaram a manter um limite na relação preço/lucro projetado por Wall Street, à medida que os analistas continuam aumentando suas estimativas. Ainda assim, com um preço de 18 vezes os lucros projetados, é a ação mais cara do índice S&P 500 – e com preço próximo ao da Tesla no seu auge.
Atualmente, a fabricante de semicondutores tem uma liderança significativa nos tipos de chips gráficos que se destacam no processamento de grandes quantidades de dados usados em modelos de IA.
No entanto seus concorrentes estão ansiosos para conquistar uma fatia desse mercado. A Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) lançou recentemente uma linha de aceleradores, e até mesmo os clientes da Nvidia, como a Microsoft (MSFT), estão correndo para desenvolver chips. “Se você realmente acredita nessa febre da IA, pode visualizar um futuro daqui a dez anos em que a IA está incorporada em muitos lugares, e você precisa desses sistemas massivos que rodam chips que só podem ser entregues pela Nvidia”, disse Sameer Bhasin, da Value Point Capital. Nada disso tem a intenção de descartar o poder disruptivo dos carros elétricos ou da IA. Mas isso levanta a questão sobre se os investidores estão pagando por um crescimento futuro que pode nunca chegar?
Assim como foi o caso da “queridinha” de mercado da era das empresas “ponto-com”, a Cisco Systems, que ainda é uma empresa de sucesso, mas em que os investidores que compraram a ação em seu auge e a mantiveram esperam até hoje para recuperar suas perdas – 24 anos depois. “A bolha existe porque a ideia subjacente é real”, disse Cole Wilcox, CEO e portfolio manager na Longboard Asset Management.
“Mas só porque a onda macrogeral é real, não significa que todos esses empreendimentos se tornarão bons investimentos. Você terá que ser capaz de separar os vencedores dos perdedores.”

Article title:  NVIDIA gallina dalle uova d'oro per TSMC, ma Apple rimane irraggiungibile

Article maintext:  Il 2023 è stato un anno incredibile per TSMC, ma quali sono stati i clienti più importanti? A dircelo sono le stime di Dan Nystedt, analista finanziario specializzato nelle compagnie di semiconduttori. Secondo i dati, NVIDIA ha rappresentato l’11% del fatturato di TSMC nel 2023, un aumento incredibile rispetto al 2022 che posiziona l’azienda capitanata da Jensen Huang al secondo posto di questa particolare classifica.
Si, perché il “Cliente A” di TSMC, quello che nei documenti SEC non è mai menzionato apertamente e che ha rappresentato il 25% del fatturato della fonderia nel 2023, finendo primo in classifica, è Apple. La società di Cupertino è da tempo il cliente più importante di TSMC e lo scorso anno ha pagato, per i propri chip, 17,52 miliardi di dollari. NVIDIA, dal canto suo, ha sborsato la bellezza di 7,73 miliardi di dollari.
Secondo Nystedt, il 91% del fatturato 2023 di TSMC è legato a soli 10 clienti, un incremento significativo rispeto all’88% registrato nel 2022. Tra questi, oltre ad Apple NVIDIA, ci sono AMD, Mediatek, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Sony e Marvell.
Sono anni che Apple è il cliente più importante di TSMC, ma era da parecchio tempo che nessun altro superava la soglia del 10%. L’enorme aumento di ordini da parte di NVIDIA è legato all’esplosione dell’intelligenza artificiale, che ha portato alle stelle la richiesta di processori NVIDIA H100 e A100, per cui TSMC cura sia la produzione dei chip che il packaging, dato che sfruttano la tecnologia CoWoS dell’azienda. NVIDIA quindi non paga solo la produzione, ma anche il packaging avanzato.
Vista l’incredibile adozione dell’IA, è quasi certo che la percentuale di NVIDIA aumenterà ancor di più nel 2024, anche considerando che l’azienda ha già prenotato una certa capacità produttiva per assicurare un’offerta costante ed evitare problemi di shortage.
Dal canto suo, anche AMD sta vivendo un periodo di richiesta sempre più alta, specialmente per quanto riguarda la famiglia di processori EPYC per data center e gli acceleratori grafici Instinct MI300; che sia la prossima azienda a superare la soglia del 10%?

Article title:  Apple sinks to lowest levels since May as EU fines $2B

Article maintext:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was hit with a fine in the amount of €1.8B, or $1.95B, as the European Commission said its App Stores rules for music streaming providers, notably Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), are considered "abusive."
Shares fell 3% in mid-day trading on Monday and hit their lowest levels since May 2023.
"For a decade, Apple has restricted music streaming app developers from informing their consumers about cheaper options available outside of the app," said Executive Vice-President of the European Commission Margrethe Vestager in a statement.
Vestager continued: "Apple did so by restricting app developers' ability to inform users of Apple devices about alternative, cheaper options to purchase music available on the internet outside of the Apple ecosystem. This is illegal. And it has impacted millions of European consumers, who were not able to make a free choice as to where, how, and at what price to buy music streaming subscriptions."
Apple issued a statement on its website, criticizing the decision.
"The decision was reached despite the Commission’s failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast," Apple said.
Apple also specifically called out Spotify by name in its statement, noting the Stockholm, Sweden-based company has 56% of the European streaming market and pays Apple "nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognizable brands in the world."
Spotify issued a statement on the EU's ruling, describing Apple's behavior as "unlawful."
"This decision sends a powerful message—no company, not even a monopoly like Apple, can wield power abusively to control how other companies interact with their customers," Spotify said.
Previous reports indicated that Apple would be fined $540M over allegedly blocking others and letting consumers know of cheaper music streaming alternatives.
The fine comes just a few days before the European Union's landmark legislation, the Digital Markets Act, is set to become law. Apple has been identified as a "gatekeeper" by the EU in conjunction with the law.
If the companies do not comply with the rules laid down by the DMA, they can be fined up to 10% of global annual turnover or 20% for repeated violations, the EC said previously.
Additional steps can be taken by the EC, including requiring a gatekeeper to sell a business or parts of it or banning the respective gatekeeper from acquiring additional services related to the non-compliance.

Article title:  Bye-Bye Apple Car: Is This a Sign to Buy, Sell or Hold AAPL Stock Now?

Article maintext:  AAPL stock has faced headwinds before, so it’s essential investors don’t overreact to the news
I’ll be the first to admit that I’m an Apple (NASDAQ: ) fan. My wife and I own at least 10 Apple products, with more to come, I’m sure. However, regarding AAPL stock, I’m afraid the company’s car debacle is a sign it might be too scared to fail.
This reluctance is not the hallmark…

Article title:  3 Questions You Should Ask When Validating A Startup Idea

Article maintext:  People queuing outside Apple Store in London, September 2022. While visiting the Apple store when a ... [+] new iPhone is released is comparatively rare, supermarket store lines are a frequent annoyance. SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images
You have an idea for a startup. How can you be certain that your startup concept holds water? Which of your myriad ideas should you pursue?
Before embarking on this entrepreneurial journey, your pre-journey phase will be to validate three core elements which are the key elements for your startup success, by asking the following:
• Perception - How is the problem perceived by the potential audience?
• Value – How significant is the problem to people?
• Size – What is the size of the potential addressable market?
Every entrepreneur's journey begins at a familiar crossroad. Once you've pinpointed the problem, the next step will be to identify who has it.
Many entrepreneurs fail in that phase. They have a personal point of view of the problem, and assume everyone shares it as well, or they might speak with very few friends, or potential business partners who may have the issue and base their conclusion that the problem is real only on that.
1. Learn who Cares About this Problem
Segmenting your audience is the key. By identifying specific groups plagued by this issue, you begin to narrow your focus. Engage in conversations with those individuals to grasp their perspective on the matter.
A true problem worth solving will resonate immediately, and people will start telling you about their experience with that problem. If your audience can't grasp the issue within seconds of your explanation, it's likely not their problem to begin with.
This process will unveil the various nuances of the problem. Take, for instance, the universal disdain for waiting in lines. While some dislike airport security queues, others dread the supermarket or any governmental/official service. Yet, which line truly warrants a solution?
To determine this, speak with 100 people to get their perception of the problem. Consider two factors: frequency of use and Total Addressable Market (TAM).
While visiting the Apple AAPL AAPL store when a new iPhone is released is comparatively rare, supermarket store lines are a frequent annoyance. And while occasional travelers might not mind airport security, frequent flyers certainly do.
So, how do you decide which problem to address? First, you need to hate it enough, it needs to be personal, one that you have the passion and the urge to solve, but this is not enough. A problem worth solving would be a widespread issue that occurs regularly. Such opportunities are few and far between. Most problems cater to niche markets or don't occur frequently enough. Niche and painful enough are good problems to solve.
2. Determine the problem's value. How big is it?
In this stage, you must determine what individuals are willing to shell out to eradicate it. Services like valet parking and Uber Eats thrive because people pay to bypass wait times, but I’ve heard of people waiting in line for Apple stores to be opened to get the new iPhone, and other people are willing to pay them for that. Line-avoiding services at the end of the day are simple exchanges of time and money, but in reality, are exchanges of frustration over money.
However, the discerning between potential and actual willingness to pay is tricky. While the former is a good indicator, it's not enough.
3. Assess Market Size
Determine the potential customer base size and the value your solution could bring. For instance, die-hard Apple fans might value cutting down their wait time for the latest iPhone more than occasional travelers value a fast pass at the airport.
If your market is broken into multiple segments, find one flavor of the problem that is worth solving and focus on it.
A problem "worth solving" is one where the total addressable market (TAM) multiplied by its value is substantial and big enough.
Then you calculate the TAM and multiply it by the willingness to pay, to figure out the size of the opportunity, if it is worthwhile, and what strategy you should use.
Only then, you will be ready to embark on your startup journey.

上週標普、那數均創歷史新高，其中標普過去 18 週中有 16 週上漲，為 1971 年以來首見，而消費者信心和製造業活動疲軟的跡象，也增強了市場對聯準會今年將降息的押注。市場目前預計聯準會將在六月開始，將基準利率從 20 多年來高位調降。
聯準會主席鮑爾將在週三向眾議院和週四向參議院提供有關貨幣政策的證詞，市場將尋找今年首次可能降息時間的線索。分析師預期驢象兩黨不會讓鮑爾輕鬆過關，民主黨很可能希望聯準會轉鴿降息以提振選舉年的經濟表現，共和黨很可能希望他放棄提高銀行資本金的計畫。

Article title:  Apple hit with over €1.8-billion EU antitrust fine in Spotify case

Article maintext:  Apple AAPL-Q was hit with an EU antitrust fine of over €1.8-billion ($1.95-billion) on Monday, its first ever, for preventing Spotify SPOT-N and other music streaming services from informing users of payment options outside its App Store.
The European Commission’s decision was triggered by a 2019 complaint by Swedish music streaming service Spotify over this restriction and…

Article title:  Apple removed from Evercore's tactical outperform list

Article maintext:  Update: The article was updated with additional information
Evercore removed Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) from its tactical outperform list noting that the tech giant's December quarter earnings report was the main catalyst for its call.
Shares fell 0.7% in premarket trading on Monday.
The iPhone maker reported first-quarter results on Feb. 1 which beat analysts' estimates. However, concerns about the company's presence in China weighed on investors' minds.
China revenues fell 12% year-over-year as weakness in the region "was more around wearables and iPads — reflecting a weaker consumer spending environment," Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani said.
Despite "the disappointment around Mar-qtr (March quarter) guide, we think iPhone units are largely flat," added Daryanani.
There are several tailwinds working in Apple's favor, including generative AI product launches, adoption of the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, sustained free cash flow and an uptick to capital allocation, Daryanani noted.
The analyst said that, positively, Apple continues to see gross-margins work higher and expects March-quarter gross-margins in the range of 46% to 47% (Street was at 45.5%) this is clearly dampening the impact of revenue miss to the bottom-line in March-quarter.
In addition, Evercore noted that Vision pro commentary is incrementally better with 600 new apps at launch and sizable interest from enterprises. In Generative AI arena — Apple expects to launch and discuss their Gen AI products later this year.
Another positive is that the 2.2B iOS install base was up 10%.
Daryanani added that while they understand the disappointment around March-quarter they think iPhone units are largely flat excluding some 1x dynamics. Thus, Evercore sees a host of tailwinds for the above reasons.
Apple (AAPL) has a Hold rating at Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system, which consistently beats the market. The Seeking Alpha authors' average rating is also Hold, but the average Wall Street analysts' rating is more positive with a Buy.

Article title:  FELG: A Buy In The Current Growth-Focused Market Climate

Article maintext:  Bet_Noire
Did you know that over 500 new ETFs were launched last year? Sure, about half that number (not half the newly launched ones, mind you) were liquidated due to underperformance, lack of liquidity, low AUMs, high expense ratios and other fees, etc., but there’s no denying that the ETF universe is becoming more attractive to investors. Fund inflows totaled nearly $600 billion last year, with nearly half of that coming in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023 alone. Q4 is typically a solid quarter for ETF inflows, so that shouldn’t be surprising, but what’s interesting is that three out of the five top performers in terms of fund flows track the broader market; specifically, the SP500.
SA - SP500TR - CY2022
SA - SP500TR - CY2023
SA - SP500TR YTD CY2024
Why should you be interested in that? The reason, and I’ve covered this before in my recent ETF articles, is that this is where the returns are coming from. After taking a beating in 2022, the SP500TR index rallied hard in 2023, and we’re not even at the end of the first quarter of CY2024 and it’s already up 8%.
This is the kind of return you want to see in your portfolio, and one of the best ways to do that in this current market is to weight it in a similar manner to the broader market. However, to extract the most alpha from your portfolio, you can choose a concentration that’s skewed towards large-cap and growth. I believe these are the two themes that 2024 is set up for, and among the best ETFs I’ve seen in this niche is Fidelity’s Enhanced Large Cap Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:FELG). I’ve already covered its sister fund, the Fidelity Enhanced Large Cap Core ETF (FELC), which I rated a Hold in this article.
My Thesis for FELG
Since this is part of the same group of ETFs that were spun off from Fidelity’s Enhanced Index Funds after about 17 years, many of the key characteristics of both FELG and FELC will be similar. However, there’s an edge where FELG is concerned, and this is the graph I ended that article with to showcase its superior return this year.
SA - FELC, FELG, SP500
That’s just the YTD gain in terms of capital appreciation, and if you look at the total return since inception, you’ll see that FELG and FELC were both finding their legs for a while after being ‘re-launched’ under their new names as ETFs, but their recent performance is clearly beating the market. More importantly, you can see the FELG edge that I just referred to.
SA - FELC, FELG, SP500TR - Since November 21, 2023
How’s FELG getting this edge, you ask? One major component of that answer is in the differences in their respective holdings…
SA - FELG vs FELC Top 10 Holdings
You’ll immediately see the advantage: the 36% weighting of the top ten holdings in FELC get a boost to more than half of the entire fund portfolio with FELG’s 53%. That’s where the extra alpha is coming from, and I’ll demonstrate that in a bit by analyzing a few of its top holdings.
The differences in the weighting of these holdings themselves are generating greater total returns, but since this is an actively managed fund like FELC, the funds can be rebalanced very quickly in the event of a market downturn - or optimized in the event of a market-disrupting development like the chase for AI revenues.
You can see this effect by looking at the fact sheet that’s dated 12.31.23 (table below) versus the current holdings dated 2.29.2024 (table above). Apple has been knocked down to second place since the end of last year, Microsoft’s position was very slightly trimmed, and Nvidia got a boost up to nearly 8% in the latest rebalancing. We could see Nvidia rising even higher on the list, but I think the composition is fairly stable now so I wouldn’t want to see any more significant asset allocation toward the fast-growing chipmaker.
SA - FELG Fact Sheet
On the management fees and expenses front, I don’t see 18 basis points as being too expensive. Both funds are equally liquid, but FELC is a little more so. I don’t see that as a good thing, but looking at FELG’s performance in comparison, I think investors are going to quickly realize that this is a period where growth trumps everything else.
And that’s the second component that’s helping this ETF outperform the market’s total return - growth. As promised, let’s take a look at just the top three holdings and how their respective metrics are driving total returns for the FELG ETF.
Top 3 Holdings Analyzed - MSFT, AAPL, NVDA
SA - FELG Top 3 Holdings’ Growth Metrics
Leaving Nvidia (NVDA) out of the picture for now, the first thing you might notice is that Apple certainly doesn’t look like a growth company when you consider its top line - but it does have a few things going for it. Apple's (AAPL) tangible book value for the past three years averaged 3.82%, which is somewhere in the neighborhood of Microsoft's (MSFT) 4.02%, only trailing by about 20 basis points. That’s a black mark for AAPL because the iPhone maker is relatively weak when it comes to asset growth, which accrues to common shareholder equity.
SA - AAPL, MSFT, NVDA Common Equity - 5Y Chart
Speaking in absolute dollar terms, MSFT is a master of equity growth, and the graph is only getting steeper over time. A closer look at the balance sheet over the years shows us that MSFT has grown shareholder equity from $102 billion in 2019 to about $238 billion as at the last reported quarter. In contrast, AAPL’s lack of equity growth is a little painful if you’re a long-term shareholder. Although total liabilities have only gone from about $248 billion to about $280 billion in the last reported quarter, asset growth has been a lot slower, moving from $338 billion or so in 2019 to the current $353 billion. For the period under consideration, that’s a cumulative growth rate of 64% for MSFT and just 4.4% for AAPL - game Microsoft!
When you look at other metrics as well, you’ll see a very similar lead-lag relationship between these two mega-caps.
Take net income margins, for example. Of course, we do have to recognize Apple’s more asset-heavy and capital-intensive model, but on a ‘ceteris paribus’ basis, MSFT is ahead of AAPL by more than 10 percentage points (36.27% vs 26.16%). Sure, Apple has better returns on capital, equity, and assets than MSFT, but again, that’s more from AAPL’s rapid asset turnover that’s double that of MSFT because of the former’s hardware focus. That balance could gradually change as AAPL’s Services segment grows stronger, but for now, Microsoft is clearly more GAAP-profitable than AAPL (despite slightly lower operating cash flows), which is important when fund managers look at potential outperformance. It’s from a lower revenue base, though, so on the whole I think Microsoft is the stronger entity in terms of profitability, too.
Another area where Microsoft shines is topline growth, as we saw above. There’s really no competition here, with MSFT pegged for a 12% forward revenue growth rate against AAPL’s meager 1.5%.
On the dividend front, not many retail investors appreciate MSFT’s double digit dividend growth rate of over 10%, which it has maintained over several years. AAPL’s div growth rate is about half that, on a five-year CAGR basis. The yields are not stellar for either of these companies, but dividend growth investors know how valuable MSFT has been to their portfolios over the last couple of decades. That also gives MSFT an edge on total return.
Personally, I think Apple has lost its shine, and although I know that’s almost sacrilegious to AAPL permabulls, the truth is that its numbers just aren’t what they used to be. I’m hoping to cover that in a subsequent article because that argument deserves a dedicated space, but it’s clear that FELG’s managers saw greater potential in MSFT over AAPL, at least for the purpose of shooting for greater alpha.
Finally, we come to the real game-changer in today’s market - the almighty NVDA.
NVDA was actually a very lucky beneficiary of the AI revolution. The company’s mid-60% growth rates in 2021 on the back of pandemic-driven demand for its products were on a decline since the peak in August 2021. Over the next two years, revenue growth went into negative territory, but only briefly. In many ways, the proliferation of generative AI since late 2022 has triggered a race for AI dominance, and NVDA was dramatically lifted out of the doldrums, eventually hitting the current 125% YoY revenue growth rate.
While some might consider this to be a bubble of sorts, I disagree with that view - and I’ll tell you why. The loose definition of a bubble is valuation growing far ahead of performance and fundamentals, and that’s not what’s happening here.
NVDA’s valuation, despite showing superior revenue growth and profitability, is very comparable to that of MSFT. NVDA is still making in the region of $60 billion on a TTM basis compared to MSFT’s $212 billion, so that needs to be factored in, but it’s still very profitable, with a net income margin at least 12 percentage points higher than MSFT’s.
In terms of valuation, the chipmaker is quite a bit more expensive on a cash flow and book value basis, and a lot of that can be contributed to the market’s enthusiasm for this stock. Again, I’ll reiterate that it’s not really a bubble in the traditional sense because earnings-related metrics still show levels that are comparable to MSFT’s. For instance, you’d be paying 33 times forward revenue growth for NVDA against 35x for MSFT, and if you look at adjusted forward earnings in terms of PEG, which adds the growth factor, NVDA sits at under 1x against MSFT’s 2.36 and AAPL’s even heftier 2.91.
Yes, the stock is certainly expensive, and I’ll not deny that, but NVDA, like Microsoft, is also an excellent builder of shareholder equity, with that metric going from $12 billion in 2019 to the current $43 billion for a cumulative growth rate of nearly 260%. That large difference to MSFT can be attributed to the difference in their starting equity values for the period under consideration, but it’s undeniable that NVDA is the one carrying a lot of the SP500’s current momentum.
My Take on FELG
Unlike FELC, I’m rating this ETF a clear Buy. The expense ratios might be similar and both funds are relatively new in the fresh avatars that Fidelity has bestowed on them, but the holdings and the fact that growth is driving the market in this current environment give me enough confidence to recommend it as a core holding.
Of course, you’ll also want to mitigate the downside risks here, which are sizeable. The moment NVDA posts a weak quarter, the market might undergo a massive correction. Any prolonged weakness in revenue growth or earnings in the next few quarters and we could be looking at a reversal of investor preference back into the value phase. I also see the fund downsizing its AAPL holding over time, especially if the numbers continue to weaken. The fund’s managers can’t afford to have lack of growth in one of their top holdings drag the whole fund’s performance down, so I suspect they’ll be watching any new developments from the Cupertino tech giant like hawks.
For your own portfolio, I’d suggest hedging it with a high-yield ETF. REITs seem to be recovering since November 2023, with a strong rally to kick things off. It’s gotten more muted this year, and real-estate-focused ETFs like The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLRE) are slightly down on a YTD basis, but most of them come with decent yields that are, at the very least, keeping up with inflation.
A better way to hedge a core FELG holding would be a business development company ETF like VanEck BDC Income ETF (BIZD), which has reasonably good liquidity and volume. This is important when you’re looking to enter or exit a considerable position to bolster or protect your portfolio, as the case may be.
In summary, I think FELG would make an excellent core holding in the current market climate when growth is paramount and the tech sector (specifically, mega-cap tech firms) is driving much of that growth. I rate it a Buy at this time, with the investment horizon being in the short- to medium-term period - or as long as the market rally on the back of large-cap growth lasts.

Article title:  Apple launches 13-inch, 15-inch MacBook Air models with M3 chip

Article maintext:  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Moday announced new MacBook Air models with 13-inch and 15-inch screen sizes with its own M3 chip.
The 13-inch model starts at $1,099 and the 15-inch model start at $1,299. Customers can pre-order both models starting today, with availability beginning March 8.
In addition, the new models offer 18 hours of claimed battery life, faster Wi-Fi 6E radios, a 1080p HD camera, and support for up to two external displays.
Apple (AAPL) unveiled its M3 series of processors in October last year, and launched the M2 MacBook Air in 2022.
Bloomberg had earlier reported that the Cupertino, California-based company was looking to unveil updated versions of the iPad and MacBook Air amid a sales slump for two of its product segments.
Mac revenue for December-ended quarter grew a measly 0.6% year-over-year to $7.78 billion. iPad revenue declined 25% to $7.02 billion.
The launch of Apple's (AAPL) new laptops coincides with the European Union fining Apple (AAPL) €1.8 billion for 'abusive' App Store rules against music streamers.

Article maintext:  Published Mar 04, 2024 08:58AM ET
© Reuters. Apple (AAPL) extends losses, down over 1% after €1.8 billion EU fine
AAPL -0.07% Add to/Remove from Watchlist
Apple (AAPL) share price decline has continued Monday, with the stock down 1.5% ahead of the open.
Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) are down 4% in 2024, with an over 5% decline in the last three months. Premarket, the stock is trading around the $176.90 mark.
Today's decline follows news that the European Commission has fined the iPhone maker over €1.8 billion for "abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps to iPhone and iPad users (‘iOS users') through its App Store."
In particular, the Commission said it found Apple had applied restrictions on app developers, preventing them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app (anti-steering provisions). A move that is illegal under EU antitrust rules.
"These anti-steering provisions are neither necessary nor proportionate for the protection of Apple's commercial interests in relation to the App Store on Apple's smart mobile devices and negatively affect the interests of iOS users," said the European Commission.
Responding to the decision, Apple argued the conclusion was reached "despite the Commission’s failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast."
The tech giant singled out Spotify as the "primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary."
"Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s — and pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognizable brands in the world," stated Apple.

Article title:  Why Dividend Investors Should Be Smiling

Article maintext:  RichVintage/E+ via Getty Images
Introduction
Since the start of interest rate hikes, some of the stocks I own have seen their share prices decline. Those who follow me probably know I have a good portion of my portfolio invested in Real Estate Investment Trusts or REITs. These are typically considered bond substitutes when rates are lower and since current rates are elevated, many investors have elected to place their money in safer alternatives like money markets or short-term treasury bonds.
I've written several articles on REITs that I considered to be attractive because of the opportunity presented by Mr. Market. And in this article I discuss why dividend investors should be smiling from ear to ear, taking advantage of this short-lived opportunity.
There was an article on Seeking Alpha recently titled: Very Bad News For Dividend Stocks by fellow analyst, Samuel Smith. In the article, he highlighted how dividend stocks have underperformed the broader market in recent years, and that REITs and utilities in particular have experienced severe underperformance.
He also discussed that there could be more bad news because inflation remains sticky, but ultimately, there is light at the end of the tunnel. I believe all of this is true, and understand where he's coming from. REITs have underperformed due to their business structures and have found it more difficult to find attractive investments for future growth recently. This is because REITs typically get accretion from investing at attractive spreads.
They also borrow debt to fund growth and with interest rates elevated, it has become more expensive to borrow. Attractive cap rates have also been harder to come by because of the current macro environment. But that's why it's important not to chase yields and park your money in high-quality companies with strong fundamentals.
Be An Opportunist
I consider myself someone who's very good at seeking out and taking advantage of opportunities. And with interest rates remaining higher for longer, a huge opportunity lies within the REIT sector right now.
Looking at the chart below, you can see that since the rapid rise in interest rates, well-known REITs' prices have moved in the opposite direction. I've chosen some of the larger ones by market cap to put into perspective how their share prices have done with the rise in rates.
Data by YCharts
Let's take a look at an example. In the next chart you can see I selected exactly a 1-year time frame from March 16, 2021, to March 16, 2022; the day before the first .25 bps rate hike. Using a starting investment of $10,000, Prologis (PLD) would've netted investors the highest amount with nearly $15k, while Simon Property Group (SPG) would've given investors $11.21k. American Tower Corp (AMT) and Realty Income (O) would have given investors $10.75k and $10.59k respectively, excluding dividends.
Data by YCharts
In the next chart, I use four of the largest, most well-known tech companies against the rise in the effective FED fund rate to see how they've fared over the same time. And as you can see, they've fared quite well with the rise in rates besides Apple (AAPL) who's remained relatively flat. The other three share prices have increased with Nvidia (NVDA) exploding, up over 240% in the last year alone.
Data by YCharts
And here you can see how much your initial $10k investment would have grown to had you invested into these four stocks since the first interest rate hike back in 2022. Your investments in NVDA and Meta Platforms (META) would have grown more than 232% and 142% respectively, while investments in APPL and Microsoft would have grown 12% and 41% respectively.
Data by YCharts
So, seeing the comparative charts, what's the moral of the story? When interest rates increase, REIT prices decline, opening up an opportunity for investors to buy great businesses at wonderful prices.
Alternatively, it seems some dividend investors have elected to place their money into tech stocks, which have seen their share prices rise greatly during this economic uncertainty. But why?
Tech stocks are known for their tremendous growth, so investors have found lower-growth stocks like REITs unattractive at the moment. I've read several comments on past articles from readers stating they could get a better yield from current treasuries and money markets. And while this may be true, those are short-term investments. As a buy-and-hold investor, I've taken advantage of suppressed share prices growing my positions, in turn growing my income stream.
Fundamentals Remain Intact
I get it's hard investing money and logging in to see your account balance has dwindled over the last two years, unless you're solely a dividend investor like myself. You should be happy because one question you have to ask yourself is: Has your income stream declined over the same period?
If the answer is yes, then there's a good chance you've probably chased yields or ignored declining fundamentals and suffered a dividend cut or two along the way. Not trying to brag, but I've managed to dodge those. Two stocks that come to the top of my head that cut their dividend are Medical Properties Trust (MPW), and Ares Commercial Real Estate (ACRE).
To let you in on a little secret, I used to own both, but that was back when I too chased yields instead of looking at the fundamentals of the company. I understand when you can get a double-digit yield, or a large quarterly dividend from a stock trading at a cheap price that can be very appealing.
But usually it's cheap for a reason. And if their fundamentals are beginning to crack like Walgreens (WBA) did, then it's probably time to look to invest your money elsewhere. The last stock I sold because of their declining fundamentals was WBA. I actually wrote two articles discussing this with the last one titled: Walgreens Q4: The Dividend Is On Life Support where I downgraded the stock because of management brushing over not raising the dividend which they had done for nearly 50 years previously.
The company was close to Dividend King status and brushing over raising it was a huge red flag to me. One reader in particular argued with me that this wasn't a big deal and the company simply elected to not raise the dividend to give the new CEO financial flexibility. We all know what happened soon after.
Cash Flows & Balance Sheets
As a dividend investor, cash flow is the most important metric you should be paying attention to. Of course there are others, but if a company has declining cash flows and are experiencing financial hardship, then they are at higher risk for a dividend cut. Maturing debt is also an important metric because this takes away capital that can be reinvested back into the business.
That's why it's also important to find and invest in companies with strong balance sheets with ample liquidity available. One of my current holdings and favorites within the Real Estate sector, (XLRE) Agree Realty (ADC), is the perfect example. The company has no debt maturing for the next four years!
And despite a challenging environment, they've continued to make accretive investments, growing their portfolio. In 2023, they surpassed the 2,000 property mark in companies, a testament to the strong management team. Their peer Realty Income was an opportunist like myself, gobbling up Spirit Realty Capital last year, taking advantage of the share price weakness. So in short, there's always an opportunity somewhere and when it presents itself, just look at it in a positive light.
Sure their share prices have fallen, but if you have a long-term outlook, you know they're going to recover, some even making new highs potentially. Not to mention your income stream has grown in the process if you've continued adding as their share prices have fallen. VICI Properties (VICI), another favorite of mine and currently my largest holding, got capital out the door every single month in 2023. That's not something a lot of companies can say!
Hold Fast
There's a saying in my prior job in the Navy where we often used the term "Hold Fast" meaning if you hold fast to an idea, you don't change your mind about it, even though people are trying to persuade you. Warren Buffett has been known to take advantage, continuing to buy investments as fall.
In a video I remember him saying:
I love it when the things we buy go down, I get euphoric. Stocks are down today and I buy more of something I was buying yesterday, I'm buying it cheaper. Now when you go to the grocery store and you buy something cheaper than you bought it the day before, you think that's terrific. But people with their stocks they think the stock knows more than they do. When the stock goes down, they say the stock is telling them something, what it's telling me is I can get more for my money.
With us seemingly closer to the end of the rate hike cycle, REITs have historically done well and even outperformed when yields are likely to move lower. Of course, past performance doesn't predict future performance, but in my opinion REIT prices will surge shortly after the first rate cut. Whether that's in June or even after, I think investors will be very happy when it does.
In the chart below you can see historically how they've done after past cycles.
Cohen & Steers
Below you can see their valuations relative to the broader equity market are below the historical median. And when rates are finally cut, I think the higher-quality REITs will command P/FFO ratios around 17x - 18x, significantly above the median of less than 13x.
Cohen & Steers
Investor Takeaway
Wrapping up this article, always remember to do your due diligence outside of what myself and other analysts here on Seeking Alpha say. In my early investing days, I invested in higher-yielding stocks whose fundamentals were not considered the strongest. And although I've avoided dividend cuts, I've learned to trust myself and data the most.
Also, remember to take things for what they are and not what you want them to be. Just because you invest in a company and like them, if their fundamentals are declining or they brush over certain financial metrics, then this warrants further investigation and is usually a red flag.
And third, keep it simple. Buy quality companies with strong financial metrics and don't chase shiny dividend yields because you will likely get burned in the long run. Continue to be an opportunist and increase your income stream while it's cheaper to do so. In other words, buy the dip!

Article title:  Technology Stocks Reeked In 2022, Roared In 2023. What’s Next?

Article maintext:  Managers' choice of how to weight the 11 stock-market sectors plans a huge role in determining their ... [+] investment performance. Illustration by Getty Creative. getty
Technology stocks had rotten performance in 2022, down about 28%. “I think many tech stocks are buys now, and will be screaming buys if they decline further,” I wrote a year ago.
Well, they didn’t decline further, but in hindsight they certainly were screaming buys.
In the 12 months through February 29, 2024, tech stocks jumped 59%. If your portfolio was heavily in tech, you could take yourself out for a congratulatory dinner at the best restaurant in town.
Here’s a rundown on how each of the market’s 11 sectors performed in the past 12 months, and my best guess on what’s coming next.
King Tech
Investors are salivating about artificial intelligence, which has pushed the technology sector up more than 10% this year on top of last year’s big gain. The sector holds many innovative and successful companies, but the stocks are getting expensive.
Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) shares fetch 69 times recent earnings, Microsoft MSFT Corp. (MSFT) 37. The multiple on Advanced Micro Devices AMD Inc. (AMD) is 389, and on Apple AAPL Inc. (AAPL) it’s 28.
For comparison, the average stock over the decades has usually sold for about 15 times earnings.
On balance, I’d pencil the tech group in for a 15% gain over the coming 12 months. My guess for the overall market is an advance of 8% to 12%.
Communications
Communications stocks were right behind technology in the past 12 months, returning 58% (including dividends). This sector is dominated by Meta Platforms Inc. (META), formerly Facebook, and Alphabet GOOGL Inc., formerly Google.
Meta had a huge run in the past 12 months, returning 180%. It was cheap a year ago, but ot now. It sells for 33 times earnings. Alphabet goes for a 24 multiple, up from 19 at the end of 2022. I’d guess this sector will match the market over the next 12 months.
Consumer Discretionary
Consumer discretionary stocks get the bronze medal for the past 12 months, with a 33% gain. This sector includes stocks such as Amazon AMZN .com Inc. Tesla TSLA Inc. and Home Depot Inc. (HD).
Consumers are ticked off because they are spending more for groceries and gas, as well as health-care and school tuition. Also, many people dislike both likely candidates in the coming Presidential election. I don’t think that bodes well for this group in the coming months. I expect it to lag behind the overall market, although I think the homebuilding industry will do well.
Industrials
Industrial stocks returned 22% over the past 12 months. I like this group because I believe it still has some bargains in it. I’m particularly partial to defense stocks and agricultural stocks.
Health Care
Health care stocks returned 16% in the 12 months through February, while the S&P 500 Total Return Index returned 30%. The health care sector usually holds up well in recessions and bear markets, but my guess is that we will avoid those headaches in 2024. Hence I expect health care to under-perform again.
Financials
Financial stocks are unpopular. Rising interest rates are a mixed blessing for them. Banks, in particular, do best when long-term rates are considerably higher than short-term rates. But at the moment the reverse is true. The financials managed a 15% gain in the past 12 months; I would expect more of the same.
Materials
The materials group contains chemicals, steel, gold and a few other basic materials. The group had a 9% return in the past 12 months. This group does best when inflation is rising, and I think (and hope) it will be falling this year.
Consumer Staples
This group, which includes safe, steady stocks such as Procter & Gamble Inc. (PG) and Colgate Palmolive Inc. (CL), eked out an 8% gain in the past 12 months. I feel that investors overpay for the presumptive steadiness, so the group doesn’t appeal to me much.
Energy
Energy was by far the best performing group in 2022, but gained a feeble 6% in the past 12 months, severely trailing the market. I like this group, as many energy stocks sell at modest multiples of earnings. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), for example, sells for 12 times earnings, Chevron CVX Corp. 13 times.
Real Estate
Also up 6% in the past 12 months was the real estate group. With more people working from home, the office market is still in the doldrums. I would avoid this group unless you know of a special situation within it.
Utilities
The only group down in the past 12 months was the utility group. It lost 1%, even after taking dividends into account. To me, utilities are unappealing now. Many are bloated with debt, at a time when interest rates look to stay fairly high.
Disclosure: I own Apple and Alphabet personally and for most clients. I own Exxon and Chevron for one or more clients. Other managers at my firm own Microsoft and Nvidia.

Article title:  陷反壟斷風波 蘋果在大西洋兩岸遭受監管機構的夾擊

Article maintext:  蘋果正受到大西洋兩岸反壟斷監管機構的擠壓。
就在這家科技巨頭準備應對美國司法部的全面訴訟之際，周一它又因涉嫌違反海外競爭法而被歐盟委員會（EC）處以 20 億美元的罰款。
蘋果打算與歐盟反壟斷監管機構的決定抗爭。據媒體報導，蘋果公司試圖說服司法部官員不要提起訴訟。
據這些報導稱，蘋果及其律師甚至在 2 月底會見了助理司法部長Jonathan Kanter，提出了最後的辯解。

長期以來，蘋果公司(AAPL)沒有受到政府反壟斷的困擾，亞馬遜(AMZN)、谷歌(GOOG, GOOGL)和 Meta(META)等大型科技公司則深受其害。
但現在情況正在發生變化。歐盟委員會作出決定後，蘋果公司股價收盤下跌超過 2.5%，今年以來跌幅超過 5%。
歐委會的行動非常具體，它對蘋果處以罰款，因為它在音樂平台市場上揮舞著支配地位的大棒，損害了競爭對手的利益。
在瑞典音樂平台 Spotify(SPOT)對蘋果商店的規則提出正式投訴後，歐盟於2019年首次對蘋果的這些做法進行了調查。
歐盟委員會認為，蘋果公司在近十年的時間裡，通過禁止軟體開發商充分告知用戶在app store之外訪問和支付其他串流媒體服務的方式，抬高了iOS用戶的音樂平台成本。
歐盟委員會稱，通過蘋果合約中的條款，非法引導應用程序主要通過App Store購買，而蘋果在App Store中收取30%的費用。

委員會在一份調查結果摘要中提到：「蘋果的行為持續了近十年，可能導致許多 iOS 用戶為音樂串流服務支付了高得多的價格，因為蘋果向開發者徵收高額佣金，並以提高app store相同服務價格的形式轉嫁給了消費者。」
對此，蘋果公司批評歐盟委員會稱，歐盟委員會的決定未能發現任何可信的損害消費者利益的證據，而且忽視了音樂流媒體市場的繁榮、競爭和快速增長。
蘋果在一篇部落格文章中說：「這一決定的主要支持者，也是最大的受益者是 Spotify。」接著指出，「Spotify 已經成長為全球最大的音樂平台，卻無需支付蘋果任何費用。」

「今日，Spotify 在歐洲音樂平台市場的份額已達 56%，是其最接近的競爭對手的兩倍多。」蘋果公司表示，並將這一成功的主要原因歸功於 App Store。
蘋果公司此前曾將 Spotify 向歐盟委員會的投訴定性為試圖免費 「無限使用 」蘋果公司的工具。
據媒體報導，美國的反壟斷調查似乎更加全面。調查人員正在調查該公司全套產品（包括 iPhone、App Store、Apple Watch、iMessage 和 AirTags）之間的整合是否阻礙了競爭。
任何試圖拆除蘋果 「圍牆花園 」生態系統的司法部訴訟都將對公司的各種收入來源構成重大威脅。蘋果的大部分現金來源於其廣受歡迎的 iPhone，在 2023 年公司 3,833 億美元的總收入中，iPhone 佔了 2,006 億美元。
但蘋果與 iPhone 相關的服務和硬體也同樣利潤豐厚。可穿戴設備、家居和配件業務（包括 Apple Watch 和 AirPods 的銷售）去年創造了 398 億美元的收入，而不斷增長的服務業務（包括 Apple Music+ 的訂閱和 App Store 的銷售）則帶來了 852 億美元的收入。

Article title:  Dow Jones Dips As Apple Gets Hit With $2 Bil Fine; These 3 Warren Buffett Stocks Near Entries

Article title:  Apple Introduces MacBook Air Laptops With New M3 Chip

Article maintext:  Key Takeaways Apple introduced MacBook Air laptops with its latest M3 chip.
The company said the M3 chip allows the MacBook Air to run faster than with older Apple and Intel chips.
The price of the 13-inch and 15-inch versions will start at $1,099 and $1,299, respectively.
Apple (AAPL) introduced new MacBook Air laptops Monday with its latest M3 chip, which the company says will allow the MacBook Air to run faster than with older Apple and Intel (INTC) chips.
The company launched the M3 in October for its iMac desktop computers and MacBook Pro laptops. Apple said that the M3 will make the MacBook Air up to 60% faster than those with its original M1 chip, and up to 13 times faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air.
Apple also is hoping to take advantage of the soaring demand for artificial intelligence (AI). In its release, the company said that “every Mac is a great platform for AI,” and the MacBook Air is “the world’s best consumer laptop for AI.” Last week, Apple reportedly canceled its electric vehicle (EV) plans as it shifts its focus toward AI initiatives.
The price of the new M3-powered MacBook Air with a 13-inch screen will begin at $1,099, while the 15-inch model will start at $1,299. Apple said that customers can order them now, with first deliveries coming this Friday.
Shares of Apple slipped about 3% in intraday trading as of about noon ET Monday as European regulators fined the tech giant nearly $2 billion over charges of violating antitrust rules, though they've gained more than 13% over the past year.

Article title:  Apple Fined Nearly $2B by EU Over App Store Practices, Says It Will Appeal the Decision

Article maintext:  Key Takeaways The European Union (EU) fined Apple around $2 billion (1.8 billion euros) for "abusive App store rules for music streaming providers" that it says violates EU antitrust laws.
Apple said that the Commission found "no credible evidence of consumer harm" and that the move will help Spotify.
Apple said it intends to appeal the decision.
The fine comes days ahead of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) going into effect on March 6.
Apple has already made changes to some of its systems for EU customers to comply with the DMA.
The European Union (EU) fined Apple (AAPL) around $2 billion (1.8 billion euros) for "abusive App store rules for music streaming providers" in a move that the iPhone maker says could bolster Spotify (SPOT).
The European Commission said in a press release Monday that it fined the company for violating EU antitrust rules and that Apple "abus[ed] its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps to iPhone and iPad users (‘iOS users') through its App Store."
"Apple applied restrictions on app developers preventing them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app (‘anti-steering provisions')," the release said.
The iPhone maker based in Cupertino, California responded that it intends to appeal the EU's decision, which it said would bolster the already dominant position of Swedish company Spotify.
"Today, the European Commission announced a decision claiming the App Store has been a barrier to competition in the digital music market," Apple said in a release, adding that "the decision was reached despite the Commission’s failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast."
Apple claimed that "the primary advocate for this decision—and the biggest beneficiary—is Spotify," which the company said met with the Commission "more than 65 times during this investigation."
The fine comes ahead of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) going into effect on March 6. The new law regulates big tech companies to promote competition, consumer choice, and innovation in the EU.
Apple, which the Commission has designated as a "gatekeeper," has already made changes to some of its systems, including the App Store and Apple Pay, to comply with the DMA.
Apple shares were down about 3% at $174.22 as of 11:50 a.m. ET Monday.

Article title:  遭歐盟重罰 蘋果長文怒斥Spotify吃霸王餐 開年來多項利空 何時出盡？

Article maintext:  蘋果 (AAPL-US) 今年迄今股價仍跌逾 9%，遠遜同期上漲近 8% 的標普 500 指數，華爾街正討論為何如此，以及可能改變情況的轉機在哪。
遭歐盟重罰近 20 億美元
蘋果周一面臨歐盟最新打擊，股價收挫 2.54%，每股降至 175.10 美元。歐盟委員會以蘋果在音樂串流媒體 app 分發市場中「利用 App Store 規則濫用其主導地位」為由，對蘋果處以近 20 億美元的罰款。
蘋果主張「歐盟委員會在沒有找到消費者利益受損的可靠證據下，就做出了這樣的處分」，因此蘋果將對此提出上訴。
歐盟表示，蘋果阻止 app 開發商向用戶提供 App Store 以外、更便宜的音樂訂閱服務資訊，此舉已違法。
歐盟此決定源於音樂串流媒體服務平台 Spotify (SPOT-US) 於 2019 年對蘋果的控訴，該訴訟涉及蘋果 App Store 向 app 開發商徵收 30% 傭金等爭議。
歐盟該決定的最大受益者是 Spotify，因為用戶若在 Spotify 網站上直接訂閱服務，Spotify 不需要向蘋果支付費用。
蘋果罕見發長文抨擊，主張 Spotify 的成功很大程度上應歸功於 App Store，但歐洲市占率達 56% 的 Spotify 從未向幫助其成為全球知名品牌的蘋果支付過任何費用，歐盟的決議相當諷刺。
蘋果指出，Spotify 於 2015 年起與歐盟展開合作，在幾乎毫無現實依據的情況下進行調查，聲稱數位音樂市場因蘋果限制競爭對手發展的作法而陷入停滯，然而，打臉的是，Spotify 本身就在持續發展，且在 App Store 的推動下，超越了全球其他數位音樂服務商。
經過 8 年調查，沒有證據表明消費者利益受損，也沒有證據表明蘋果作法存在反競爭行為。反觀歐洲消費者比以往擁有更多選擇，數位音樂訂閱用戶人數自 2500 萬增長到近 1.6 億人，活躍用戶超過 3 億人，其中 Spotify 是此增長趨勢的最大贏家。
然而，不只如此，過去一個月還有很多其他原因導致蘋果股價下跌。
遭高盛剔除「必買名單」
投資銀行高盛上周五將蘋果自「必買名單」（conviction list）中剔除，但沒有透露背後想法，引發市場擔憂，蘋果股價應聲下滑。蘋果在該名單內停留了 274 天。
放棄汽車計畫 100 億美元打水漂
此外，《彭博》報導，知情人士透露，蘋果 2 月底時內部傳出將放棄已投資 100 億美元的汽車計畫，並將焦點轉向生成人工智慧 (Gen AI)。
財測遜色 iPhone 銷量恐大減近 10%
蘋果上月初公布 12 月季度的財報時，管理層對 3 月季度的財測令人失望，該季度營收整體將年減 5% 至約 900 億美元，因為 iPhone 銷量預計大減近 10%。
然而，Melius Research 力排眾議，認為沒有理由恐慌。分析師 Ben Reitzes 和 Nick Monroe 周一寫道：「蘋果 6 個季度 (含本季) 中有 5 個季度缺乏成長，這點顯然罕見，但現在是深呼吸的時候了，蘋果活躍安裝基礎超過 22 億台，且 99% 用戶永遠不會轉向 Android，因此隨時可能捲土重來。」他們將股票評為「買進」，目標股價為 220 美元。
分析師指出蘋果可能面對的兩大挑戰：中國營收恐下降、谷歌的反壟斷案件恐遭不利判決
司法部 2020 年起訴谷歌，這恐損害蘋果公司的利益，因為谷歌向蘋果支付 Safari 瀏覽器默認搜尋引擎的費用，若谷歌遭不利判決，恐影響蘋果這項巨大且重要的營收來源，儘管谷歌恐需纏訟多年才會有結果。
投資者應關注蘋果人工智慧 (AI) 戰略的消息，蘋果預計 6 月公布，分析師稱這是「自 iPhone 後最重要的發布」，因為 AI 功能可望推動蘋果服務業，並促使大量用戶於 2025 年升級手機。
Evercore ISI 分析師 Amit Daryanani 也表達了類似的想法，他稱蘋果季度財報雖有些棘手要素，但他仍對蘋果的未來抱持樂觀態度，其有利因素包括：從 Gen AI 產品的發佈、Vision Pro 的採用、持續產生自由現金流，以及資本配置的增加。
Evercore 對蘋果的評級為「跑贏大盤」，目標價為 220 美元，

Article title:  Apple stock keeps dropping as bad news piles up

Article maintext:  Apple shares keeps dropping this year, as bad news, from being M.I.A. from generative AI to huge antitrust fines, piles up. Wall Street analysts chattering about what might change Apple’s trajectory.
Emily Dattilo for Barron’s:
‎
The stock was down 2.8% at $174.68 on Monday morning. This year, shares are 9.3% lower, while the S&P 500 is up 7.6%.
The latest blow came Monday, when the European Commission said it was fining Apple nearly $2 billion over what it called “abusive App Store rules” for music-streaming providers.
On Friday, Goldman Sachs removed the company from its U.S. Conviction List—a list that the investment bank said includes 20 to 25 “of what we believe to be our most differentiated fundamental Buy ideas across our U.S. stock coverage”—without disclosing the thinking behind the move. Apple had spent 274 days on the list.
At the end of February, the company said internally that it was abandoning its car project and would be channeling focus toward generative artificial intelligence, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The company needs to deal with two sizable challenges: a potential drop in revenue in China and a possible ruling against Google in its antitrust case, the analysts said, referring to a 2020 lawsuit the Justice Department filed against Google.

Article title:  Top Stock Movers Now: Tesla, Macy's, Super Micro Computer, and More

Article maintext:  Key Takeaways The record-setting pace for the S&P 500 stumbled at midday Monday, March 4, 2024, with the index little changed ahead of key economic data coming this week.
Tesla shipments in China sank, and shares of the EV maker tumbled.
Super Micro Computer shares surged after S&P Global said it would be added to the S&P 500.
The S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq were little changed and slightly lower to start the new week ahead of key economic reports and earnings coming later in the week.
Shares of Tesla (TSLA) slumped as data from China showed the EV maker’s shipments from its Shanghai plant dropped to their lowest level since December 2022.
Apple (AAPL) shares declined as European regulators fined the tech giant nearly $2 billion, claiming Apple violated antitrust laws.
Shares of Chevron (CVX) fell as the energy giant shut down two biodiesel plants in the U.S. Midwest because of a soft market.
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares surged after S&P Global said late Friday it would be added to the S&P 500 starting March 18.
Ford (F) shares jumped after the carmaker reported sales were up 10.5% in February as demand increased for hybrid and electric vehicles.
Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) climbed after the rally for the AI chipmaker pushed its market capitalization past that of Saudi Arabian oil giant Saudi Aramco to make it the third-most valuable public company in the world.
Oil futures slipped and gold prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note gained. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro and pound, but was up versus the yen. Bitcoin traded above $66,000, and most other major currencies gained as well.

Article title:  Apple AI and why investors should expect revenue growth

Article maintext:  Another day, another case of Apple stoking the growth fire on Wall Street with the magical two letters: AI.
Tim Cook’s shareholder meeting comments about Apple breaking new ground for AI this year were intended to excite investors. According to one analyst, however, the market has not been persuaded by promises. Still, they make the case for one investors should be optimistic about the company’s revenue growth with AI.
Meanwhile, Apple has found new ways to market existing silicon using AI. The term AI, not the technology, that is.
AI-fueled growth
Gene Munster, who is the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, characterizes today’s AAPL stock drop as a vote of no confidence from investors over Apple’s AI strategy:
$AAPL is down 3% today because investors are voting they have limited confidence in their AI strategy. By now it’s become clear that this June we will see their first foundation model, something that will compete with GPT, Gemini, xAI, Anthropic. The part that is not known is what does a foundation model mean for Apple’s business?
However, Munster predicts that Apple AI still has the potential to move the ball forward from a revenue perspective:
AI can move the earnings needle. Apple has 2.2B active devices, which I estimate are owned by 1.4B active users. If 20% of Apple’s active base subscribe to an AI product (personalized AI) at $10 a month, that’s $33B a year in 80% margin revenue, which would increase operating income by 16%. ($155B in operating income in CY23).
He likens the potentially shortsighted view by investors to a similar situation with Meta when the longview was out of focus:
AAPL stock action this year reminds me a little of when in the fall of 2022 investor concern that Meta would lose share to TikTok pressured the stock to $100. In the end, these products (Meta, Google Search, Microsoft Office and Apple Services) are sticky in the long-term.
AI hype
So what do we actually expect from Apple in the AI category this year?
Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he believes Apple will “break new ground” on generative AI this year. A few weeks prior, Cook promised Apple AI announcements coming later this year — likely WWDC in June. That’s when iOS 18 will be unveiled, which Mark Gurman at Bloomberg has frequently reported will focus on AI features.
And last fall, Apple briefly mentioned generative AI when it introduced new auto-correct and text prediction features across its platforms.
Artificial Intelligence has long been a focus of the company, of course. In recent years, Apple has marketed the neural engine component of Apple silicon chips. Features that use the neural engine have been described as ML, or machine learning, but Apple is privy to the lingo change.
AI, AI, AI
Just this morning, Apple released a press release that describes the M3 MacBook Air as the best consumer laptop for AI. (It uses the same M3 chip as the late 2023 14-inch MacBook Pro for a few hundred dollars more.)
And Apple isn’t just doing a find-and-replace on ML to AI. Generative AI is fueling the last 12 months of AI hype, and Cook specifically called out generative AI in recent comments. The quickly advancing category of AI is also name dropped in the MacBook Air press release.
So on one hand, we have Apple highlighting features that we don’t really think of as AI since generative AI took our attention:
Leveraging this incredible AI performance, macOS delivers intelligent features that enhance productivity and creativity, so users can enable powerful camera features, real-time speech to text, translation, text predictions, visual understanding, accessibility features, and much more.
But there is also this paragraph:
With a broad ecosystem of apps that deliver advanced AI features, users can do everything from checking their homework with AI Math Assistance in Goodnotes 6, to automatically enhancing photos in Pixelmator Pro, to removing background noise from a video using CapCut. Combined with the unified memory architecture of Apple silicon, MacBook Air can also run optimized AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models for image generation locally with great performance. In addition to on-device performance, MacBook Air supports cloud-based solutions, enabling users to run powerful productivity and creative apps that tap into the power of AI, such as Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, Canva, and Adobe Firefly.
That more clearly describes the type of AI that Apple hasn’t delivered yet beyond being a platform under it. That’s less important when it comes to server-backed AI on the web.
Bottom line: Expectations are through the roof for iOS 18 and WWDC 2024. If we see more features like what already exist from Apple, Wall Street won’t be impressed. But if Apple really has broken new ground for generative AI as a category (and not just for Apple), well, then maybe Munster’s growth vision can be realized.
Who knows, maybe we’ll all be creating Apple Vision Pro apps by talking to Siri come June.

Article title:  Has A.I. Hype Driven Magnificent Seven Stocks Beyond 90s Tech Bubble?

Article maintext:  As A.I. drives up the Big Tech stocks, caution is building up among experts. Last week, Apollo’s chief economist, Torsten Sløk, pointed out that today’s top 10 companies by market cap are more overvalued than those during the tech bubble of the mid-1990s, where the Nasdaq saw an 800 percent surge before plummeting 740 percent by 2002.

Goldman Sachs recently released a note showing hedge funds unloaded tech stocks at the fastest pace in seven months in the week ended Feb. 23. A separate research note by Morgan Stanley noted a similar trend.
Many experts agree that today’s stock market looks eerily like the one before the dot-com crash of 2000. Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett, for one, called the current stock market a “baby bubble.” Similarly, economist David Rosenberg said markets are responding to companies advertising their AI capabilities just like when 90s tech stocks would appreciate “just because they added ‘.com’ to the name.”
At the center of the A.I. market boom are the “Magnificent Seven” companies, composed of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META) Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla (TSLA). These seven stocks alone represent 30 percent of the S&P 500’s market cap. The last time the S&P 500 was this top-heavy by market cap weight was 1970, per Axios.
Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Apple each described investing in A.I. among their highest priorities in recent earnings calls and reports. Meta CEO Zuckerberg said his company’s major goal moving forward will be “building the most popular and most advanced A.I. products and services.” Microsoft has touted its success in being an early investor of OpenAI. Amazon recently invested $1 billion in A.I. robot start-ups. Tesla, having long promised full self-driving, last month released an updated beta version that leverages better neural network technology.
NYU professor Gary Marcus highlights that A.I. capabilities may be overhyped, pointing to the persistent issue of A.I. hallucination, where systems generate or distort facts. He elaborates in his Substack, “Hallucinations are in their silicon blood… to blithely assume that the problem will soon disappear is to ignore 20 years of history.” This problem, Marcus argues, could hinder A.I.’s ability to deliver anticipated value to companies driving high financial valuations. Marcus points to similar overhyped A.I. products in the past, like Facebook’s A.I. assistant and IBM Watson.
One of the biggest limitations to A.I. capabilities, as described by University of Cambridge researchers, is the “curse of recursion,” which showcases how A.I. trained on A.I.-generated information causes lapses in its knowledge and less useful outcomes. As the internet fills with A.I.-generated content, LLM and text-to-video models that train on web-scraped data will plateau in their generative abilities. Moving outside of web-scraping to source training material for A.I. can be manual and costly.
Despite these hurdles, the transformative potential of A.I. cannot be dismissed. And many esteemed financiers, including Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, don’t see an A.I. bubble. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai described A.I. technology as “more profound” for humanity than electricity or fire. McKinsey Global Institute estimates A.I. could increase worldwide corporate profits by up to $4 trillion a year.
While Nvidia symbolizes the excitement surrounding A.I., broader benchmarks like the MSCI USA IMI Robotics & AI Select Net USD Index have seen more modest gains of 47 percent. Goldman Sachs also wrote in a note to clients that call options on Nvidia are at a two-year high, showing positive speculative positions on the stock.

Article title:  American Companies Are Worried About China's Slowing Economy. Here's What They're Saying

Article maintext:  Key Takeaways China’s economy has slowed and is forecast to shrink this year, creating issues for some American corporations.
Apple, Ford, HSBC, and Starbucks are among the companies that said China’s economy was creating headwinds in their most recent earnings reports.
Marriott International and Applied Materials were among the companies that said they are experiencing growing sales in China.
As exports slow and the real estate sector weakens, China’s economy has begun to decelerate, and some American companies are beginning to feel the impact.
China’s gross domestic product (GDP) was around 5% in 2023, however, economists expect the country's economic growth to slow to around 4.6% this year and decline further in the coming years. Some corporations that do business in the nation have experienced the impacts of changes to China’s economy.
Some companies like Apple Inc. and Starbucks Corp. posted drops in revenue in the final quarter of 2023, in part because of lagging sales in China. At the same time, others, like Marriott International Inc. and Applied Materials Inc., have strong forecasts for sales in the country.
Here’s what some executives had to say about China during the latest round of earnings calls.
Apple
Smartphone sales were down across the board in China, and Apple (AAPL) reported that its sales in China fell by 13% in its December quarter, which CEO Tim Cook said could more closely be tied to its sales of devices other than the iPhone.
Despite the recent contraction, Cook said he was excited about the company’s long-term growth potential in the country, where its iPhone in 2023 became the top-selling smartphone.
“If you look at iPhone in China Mainland, which I think has been the focus of a lot of interest, and you look at it in constant currency, so more of an operational view, we were down mid-single digits on iPhone,” Cook said. “And so it was the other things that drove the larger contraction year-over-year.”
Ford
While Ford Motor Co. (F) delivered a strong earnings report, it forecast losses of as much as $5.5 billion on its line of electric vehicles (EVs), with weakness in China playing a role as the company plans fewer investments in the country, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) James Farley said Feb. 6.
“All of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost and efficiency in our EV products because the ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese OEMs [original equipment manufacturers],” Farley said. “We don't think it's a good time to jump in with both feet in China with EVs, but we're allowing our partners' platforms to lead our electrification.“
However, Farley said China remained a “very profitable overseas market” for gas-powered vehicle sales.
Starbucks
Coffee seller Starbucks (SBUX) is also feeling the pressure from China’s economy. While same-store sales were up 10% year-over-year in the December quarter, the average ticket for Chinese sales was down 9%.
“We experienced a slower-than-expected recovery in China, driven by a more cautious consumer,” said Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan. “The market is going through a transition as we see an increase in mass-market competitors.”
The company has plans to address “unexpected headwinds” in that country which include opening more stores there, offering more localized products, and using technology to improve the supply chain, Narasimhan said.
Marriott International
Hotel chain Marriott International (MAR) pushed its worldwide revenue higher with help from a 17% revenue-per-room increase from its international markets, with growth in China helping to contribute. Company officials said construction of new properties in China was resuming after the country’s strict COVID restrictions led to a pause in some projects.
“When we look at our overall growth in rooms in Asia Pacific, we're in the high‐single digits, that we're looking at, both in 2023 and 2024, including China and Asia Pacific outside of China,” said Leeny Oberg, Marriott International chief financial officer (CFO).
HSBC
British-based financial institution HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBC) said in its earnings call that it took impairment charges in 2023 related to its business in China.
However, despite the losses, HSBC said it wasn’t forecasting any additional downside for its Chinese associate, Bank of Communications Co. (BoCom), and that its executives were still upbeat on its prospects in China.
“We are also ideally positioned to capitalize as the mass affluent population in Hong Kong and mainland China continues to grow, driven by rapid urbanization across mainland China,” said Noel Quinn, HSBC Group CEO. “We grew new-to-bank retail customers in Hong Kong by 36% over the last three years, including by capitalizing on the significant increase of visitors from mainland China post re-opening.”
Applied Materials
Chip manufacturing equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT) reported Feb. 15 that revenue from China jumped 45% in its fiscal first quarter. There’s no indication that such sales are ready to slow down in the country, executives said.
“Just to be clear, we'll expect another quarter in Q2, in our outlook quarter, that it should remain elevated,” CFO Brice Hill said.

Article title:  Stock market today: S&P 500, Nasdaq retreat from records, bitcoin marches closer to new highs

Article maintext:  US stocks closed lower on Monday as investors girded for a week where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony and the monthly jobs report could put equity gains to the test.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell just below the flatline after ending Friday with its 16th weekly win in 18 weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4% as a drop in both Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) shares weighed on the tech heavy index.
Stocks have racked up gains amid a relentless AI-spurred run-up in techs, which helped the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) finally nail a fresh all-time high after a years long wait last week.
The tech rally, and Nvidia's (NVDA) breakneck rise to a $2 trillion valuation in particular, has prompted concerns about a building bubble — though some analysts are less worried. Shares of the chipmaker rose 6% to new all time highs during Monday's session.
Also on Monday, bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose more than 7% to hover above $67,000 as the cryptocurrency inched closer towards a record high, while Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index (^N225) breached the key 40,000 level for the first time.
Gold futures (GC=F) gained as April contracts settled at a record $2126.3 per ounce.
A dose of reality could lie ahead for the high hopes and the hype, when the Fed's Powell steps up to speak and the February jobs data arrives. Both will play into calculations for interest rate cuts and shed light on whether the US economy is headed for a "soft landing" or stagflation. Powell is set to give testimony to Congress on Wednesday, while the labor data is due on Friday.
In a shot across the bows for Big Tech, EU antitrust regulators fined Apple about $2 billion over App Store restrictions on Spotify (SPOT) and other music streaming services. Apple shares slipped 2.5% after the news.
Among big movers, shares in Super Micro Computer (SMCI) popped as much as 25% to a new all-time high on Monday ahead of the AI server maker's entry on the S&P 500.
Story continues
Macy's (M) stock jumped about 14% after bidders Arkhouse and Brigade raised their buyout offer to $6.6 billion, a 33% premium to the closing price on Friday.
Spirit Airlines (SAVE) shares fell more than 10% and JetBlue stock (JBLU) rose as much as 5% after the low-cost carriers announced the termination of their $3.8 billion merger agreement. A federal judge blocked the deal back in January.

Article title:  S&P 500 tem leve queda com investidores à espera de dados econômicos dos EUA

Article maintext:  O índice S&P 500 fechou em ligeira baixa nesta segunda-feira, em sessão de negociações agitadas, com investidores à espera dos dados econômicos e do depoimento do chair do Fed, Jerome Powell, no Congresso dos Estados Unidos.
A Apple (AAPL34; AAPL) fechou em queda de 2,5% após uma multa antitruste de 2 bilhões de dólares da União Europeia por impedir que o Spotify e outros serviços de streaming de música informem aos usuários as opções de pagamento fora de sua App Store.
As altas nas ações de chips, incluindo a Nvidia (NVDA; NVDC34), ajudaram a levar o S&P 500 a novos picos intradiários durante a sessão, conforme investidores continuaram a apostar na demanda por produtos que alimentam a inteligência artificial (IA), embora estivessem amplamente cautelosos antes dos dados econômicos.
Assessores e consultores de investimentos ganham R$ 15.000/mês; saiba como seguir carreira
Mas o S&P 500, depois de ficar ligeiramente positivo no final do pregão, começou a perder terreno novamente na última hora de negociação para cair novamente para território negativo nos últimos minutos de negociação.
Os investidores estavam no aguardo por pistas sobre a saúde da economia dos EUA a partir de dados mensais importantes, como leituras sobre o setor de serviços, na terça-feira, e dados da folha de pagamento fora do setor agrícola, na sexta-feira, de acordo com Scott Wren, estrategista sênior de mercado global do Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
O Dow Jones (DJI) caiu 0,25%, para 38.989,83 pontos. O S&P 500 (SPX) perdeu 0,12%, para 5.130,95 pontos. O índice de tecnologia Nasdaq (US100) cedeu 0,41%, para 16.207,51 pontos.
O índice de serviços de comunicação do S&P 500 foi o setor mais fraco do índice de referência, com queda de 1,5%, enquanto o de serviços públicos, que subiu 1,6%, foi o que mais avançou no dia.
Investidores também estão aguardando os comentários do chair do Fed, Powell, que falará a parlamentares na quarta e quinta-feira.

Article title:  Apple is heavily underperforming QQQ; Why is AAPL lagging behind its tech peers?

Article maintext:  Published Mar 04, 2024 04:03PM ET
© Reuters
AAPL -0.07% Add to/Remove from Watchlist QQQ +1.52% Add to/Remove from Watchlist NVDA +4.47% Add to/Remove from Watchlist TSLA +1.20% Add to/Remove from Watchlist MSFT +1.75% Add to/Remove from Watchlist
Big Tech stock's march continues at full throttle, propelling the broader equity market to high after high. Amidst this uptrend, the Invesco QQQ, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index, rose more than 10% year-to-date, closing at a new record high of 445.61 on Friday.
Remarkably, the QQQ’s ascent has been driven by only a handful of Big Tech firms, most notably the burgeoning AI chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ). On the other hand, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) stock, alongside Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: ) continues its underperformance, losing more than 9% and 24%, respectively, since the start of 2024.
The AAPL/QQQ divergence
Weighing in on this matter, a BTIG technical analyst observed a significant divergence between AAPL and QQQ, noting that the tech giant’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is unusually low compared to the latter.
According to the analyst, such a discrepancy hasn’t been since Volmageddon – a major market event in 2018 marked by an unexpected and extreme volatility spike.
“Apple (AAPL, Not Rated) daily RSI is at 27 while QQQ daily RSI is at 66. Since QQQs inception in 1999, there has never been a day when AAPL's RSI was below 30 while QQQs RSI was above 65, like it is now,” the analyst said in a Monday note.
“If we loosen the parameters to AAPL RSI sub-35, there is only one other time: Jan 29th-31st, 2018, right before 'volmageddon,’” he added.
Does the AAPL/QQQ divergence signal another Volmageddon-like downturn?
The BTIG analyst doesn’t think so. While they acknowledged that there is potential for increased market volatility or correction, they seem to assess the current financial and economic indicators as not aligning with those preceding the extreme volatility of Volmageddon.
“There have been lots of 'signals' over the last few weeks that we haven't seen since either the Aug. '20 'tech whale blowoff' or 2018's 'volmageddon'. None of these have led to any sort of pullback on the indices,” wrote the analyst.
“Despite that, the dispersion under the surface shouldn't be ignored. Yes, it's encouraging to see some broadening beyond the 'AI' trade, but the continued one-way move in many momentum names is ultimately going to have some ramifications, even if only short-term in nature,” he added.
Why is AAPL stock underperforming the QQQ?
BTIG analysts believe the discrepancy between Apple stock and QQQ “is likely to resolve,” potentially through an upturn in AAPL's value or a downturn in QQQ's. The broker thinks the latter scenario is more likely to happen, although they have been proven wrong so far.
Recently, Apple stock has made 2.5-year lows against the tech-oriented ETF. While the company has faced notable challenges lately – lagging domestic sales, poor Vision Pro reviews, and regulatory headwinds in China – one particular obstacle the iPhone maker seems to be facing is its unfavorable position in the AI boom.
This may have inadvertently turned Apple stock into a source of funds, enabling investors to redirect capital towards leading AI leaders such as NVDA and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ), which have been the primary drivers of QQQ’s record-breaking rise.

미 공군이 AI를 기반한 무인전투기 개발에 박차를 가하고 있습니다. CCA라고 알려진 이 무인기들은 미 국방부가 60억달러를 들여 투자한 프로그램의 일부인데요 공군은 현재 개발 중인 미니 전투기 중 최소 1,000대 보유를 원하고 있고, 5년 이내에 수백 대가 개발될 예정입니다.
AI 무인전투기들은 미국의 5세대 스텔스기 F-35와 F-22 전투기, 신형 B-21 전략폭격기 등을 호위하는 ‘윙맨’ 역할을 하는데요. 무인전투기는 감시와 정찰 임무와 함께 자체 무기를 탑재해 표적을 공격하는 것까지 다양한 작전을 수행할 수 있습니다. 미 국방부는 보잉, 록히드마틴, 노스럽그루먼, 제너럴 아토믹스, 안두릴 등 방산 업체 중 두 곳을 선정할 예정입니다.

4일(현지시간) ANZ 그룹은 제롬 파월 연방준비제도(연준·Fed) 의장이 오는 6일과 7일 예정된 미 상하원 반기 통화정책보고에서 기존 발언과 다른 얘기가 나오지는 '않을 것'이라고 전망했습니다. ANZ 연구원들은 "이번 연설에서 파월 의장은 새로운 단서를 제공할 가능성은 낮고, 금리인하를 결정하기 전에 연준은 인플레이션 완화 신호를 더 봐야 한다는 점을 거듭 강조할 것"이라고 내다본 것입니다.
그런 가운데 ANZ 그룹은 현재 미국경제가 "상당히 양호한 상태"를 유지하고 있다고 평가하면서도 "인플레이션 완화가 연준이 목표로 하는 2% 수준의 지속 가능성에 자신감을 갖기에는 충분하지 않다"라고 진단했습니다. 또한 오는 8일 발표되는 2월 비농업('NFP') 고용보고서에 대해서 ANZ 그룹 연구원들은 "보다 완만한 속도로 증가할 것"이라고 예상하면서도 "연준이 바라는 수준은 넘어설 것"이라고 덧붙였습니다.

"이와 같은 성장 둔화와 실망스러운 가이던스를 반영하여, 당사는 애플을 Tactical Outperform 종목에서 제외한다"라고 밝혔습니다. 하지만 "iPhone 추이에 악재로 작용하고 있는 요소들은 대부분 단기적 현상에 불과하다. 앞으로 인공지능 제품을 출시하고 자본배분을 보다 유리하게 조정하면서 애플의 주가 상승 모멘텀은 유지될 수 있다"라고 기대했습니다. 투자의견 outperform과 목표주가 220달러를 유지했습니다.
테슬라(TSLA) CEO 일론 머스크가 OpenAI와 샘 올트먼 CEO를 '뭐라고, 뭐라고' 고소를 했죠. 그런데 정작 부당 이익을 취한 건 머스크였습니다. 지난 2018년 머스크가 테슬라에서 받은 74조 원의 스톡옵션이 문제가 됐습니다. 머스크의 영향력 아래 있던 테슬라 이사회가 거액의 성과급을 지급했다는 겁니다.

당시 테슬라 주식 단 9주를 보유했던 소액주주가 무효 소송을 제기했고, 머스크는 1심에서 패했습니다. 당장 74조 원을 토해내야 하는 상황에서 이번엔 8조 원짜리 청구서가 날아들었습니다. 소액주주를 대리했던 변호인단이 테슬라 이사회에 테슬라 주식 2,900만 주를 요구하고 나선 겁니다.

'테슬라'는 1분기 판매 부진 가능성도 커졌습니다. 중국 상하이 공장 판매대수(중국내수 + 수출) 1,2월 합계가 13.1만대로 전년 14.0만 대 대비 -6%로 감소했습니다. 중국 내의 경쟁 강도가 높아진 것과 유럽의 보조금 축소로 인한 수요부진이 주원인입니다.
'미국' 판매도 수요가 '부진'합니다. 하이랜드 모델 라인 개조로 인한 지연, 사이버트럭의 낮은 생산 수율로 성장 기대가 어렵습니다. 3월 판매 정상화된다는 가정하에도 1분기 판매 42~43만 대 수준으로 전년동기(42.3만 대)와 유사한 레벨일 것으로 예상됩니다.

3년 만에 전년 4분기(48.5만 대) 대비 역성장하는 1분기가 되는 것은 100% 확실시되고 있습니다. 지난 하반기부터 시작된 테슬라의 성장 속도 둔화가 더 가팔라지고 있는 상태인데요. BYD에 이어 테슬라까지 전기차 수요 둔화를 체감할 수 있는 1,2월 판매를 보였습니다. 금일 '전기차·퀀텀' 섹터는 미국 대법원이 4일(현지시간) 트럼프의 대선 출마 자격 유지를 결정했다는 뉴스가 나오면서 폭락을 했습니다.

내부 통제 문제를 언급'하고 갑작스러운 CEO 교체를 발표하며 지난주 주가가 급락한 뉴욕커뮤니티뱅코프(NYCB)가 4일(현지시간)에도 하락 폭을 확대했습니다. 다우존스 뉴스와이어 보도에 따르면 이날 정오 거래에서 뉴욕커뮤니티뱅코프의 주가는 15.49% 하락한 3달러를 기록하며 지난 1996년 이후 최저 수준까지 추락했습니다. NYCB 주가는 올해 들어 69% 폭락을 했는데요. NYCB는 지난달 29일 장 마감 후 SEC에 제출한 4분기 실적 수정보고서에서 대출 심사와 관련된 중대한 약점을 발견했다고 밝힌 뒤 토마스 칸케미 CEO의 갑작스러운 교체 사실을 알렸습니다

JP모건은 성장, 배당, 가치 및 단기 전략을 중심으로 3월의 선호주 목록을 '업데이트'했고 '페라리'는 매도로 하향 조정됐습니다. 배런스 보도에 따르면 포드(F)가 2월 견조한 판매 실적을 기록했습니다. 미국 2월 판매 실적을 발표한 포드는 2월 전년 동기 대비 10.5% 증가한 17만 4,192대의 차량을 판매했습니다.
BEV 판매량은 총 6,368대로 전년 동기 대비 약 80% 증가했고 하이브리드 판매량은 1만 2,045대로 약 32% 증가했습니다. 전체 판매량에서 배터리 전기차가 차지하는 비중은 약 3.7%로 전년 동기 2.2%보다 높아졌습니다. BEV와 하이브리드를 포함한 총 전기차 판매량은 전체 판매량의 약 10.6%를 차지했습니다. 이는 1년 전 약 8%에서 증가한 수치입니다.

뉴욕증시서 반도체주가 4일(현지 시각) 일제히 강세를 보였습니다. 기술주와 반도체주는 S&P500의 상승을 이끌고 있다고 CNBC는 분석을 했습니다. 엔비디아는 6% 상승해 869달러선에서 거래됐고 장중에 876.95달러선까지 오르며 또다시 사상 최고치를 다시 썼습니다.

슈퍼 마이크로 컴퓨터는 이달 말에 S&P500에 편입된다는 소식에 20% 이상 급등했습니다. 또, 인텔은 3%, AMD는 5%, HP는 11% 급등했습니다. 다만, 그 가운데서도 '테슬라'는 장중에 7% 넘게 낙폭을 키웠고 애플 또한 유럽연합의 반독점 벌금 부과 후 3% 넘게 하락했습니다.
대만 '가권지수'가 사상 최고치를 경신했고 일본 닛케이 지수가 사상 처음 4만 선을 돌파했죠. 경제 읽어주는 '김광석'에 따르면 '한국'은 "잃어버린 30년"이 시작된 가운데 일본에선 "잃어버린 35년이 끝나는 것 아닌가" 하는 기대감이 커지고 있습니다. 주가 상승 여력을 감안하면 AI에 몰빵 좀 하지 말고 반도체/바이오/금융(보험)/에너지로 '바벨 전략'이 '유효하다'는 결론이 나옵니다.

Article title:  Apple is heavily underperforming QQQ; Why is AAPL lagging behind its tech peers?

Article maintext:  Big Tech stock's march continues at full throttle, propelling the broader equity market to high after high. Amidst this uptrend, the Invesco QQQ, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index, rose more than 10% year-to-date, closing at a new record high of 445.61 on Friday.
Remarkably, the QQQ’s ascent has been driven by only a handful of Big Tech…

Article maintext:  The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 has gone 303 trading sessions without a pullback of 2.5% or more, the third-longest stretch since 1990, according to Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG.
While this doesn’t necessarily mean the artificial-intelligence-driven boom in U.S. stocks is ripe for a selloff, Krinsky thinks the market is overdue for a bout of volatility.

Article title:  Apple lança laptops MacBook Air com chips M3 mais rápidos

Article maintext:  A Apple (AAPL34; AAPL) revelou nesta segunda-feira um par de novos laptops MacBook Air equipados com os processadores M3 em aposta que os modelos mais potentes atrairão consumidores que desejam atualizar seus equipamentos.
Os novos modelos de MacBook Air vêm com telas de 13 e 15 polegadas e são até 60% mais rápidos do que o modelo com o processador M1 da Apple, informou a empresa.
Os preços do modelo menor começam em 1.099 dólares nos Estados Unidos, enquanto a versão básica do MacBook Air maior custa 1.299.
Ambos estão disponíveis para pedidos a partir desta segunda-feira, com entregas programadas para começar no final desta semana, disse a Apple, que desde 2020 usa seu próprio chip depois de dedicir parar de usar microprocessadores da Intel.
O mercado espera que a introdução de PCs habilitados para tarefas de inteligência artificial ajude a impulsionar uma recuperação no setor em 2024.
As vendas de Macs subiram ligeiramente, para 7,78 bilhões dólares, no último trimestre , após queda de um terço no trimestre anterior.

Article title:  Apple M3チップを搭載したMacBook Airは、引き続きピークパフォーマンスを維持できない/256GBモデルはSSD速度がM1モデル以下の可能性があるので注意を。

Article maintext:  記事内に広告が含まれています。
Apple M3チップを搭載したMacBook Airは、引き続きピークパフォーマンスを維持できない/256GBモデルはSSD速度がM1モデル以下の可能性があるので、予約の際は注意してください。詳細は以下から。
Appleは現地時間2024年03月04日、昨年10月に発表したMacBook Pro (14インチ, Nov 2023)と同じ3ナノメートルテクノロジー(3nmプロセス)のApple Silicon「Apple M3チップ」を搭載した「MacBook Air (13/15インチ, M3, 2024)」の予約注文を本日より開始し、
03月08日より販売を開始すると発表しましたが、このMacBook Air (13/15インチ, M3, 2024)は引き続きファンレス仕様で、筐体がM2チップを搭載した「MacBook Air (M2, 2022)」および「MacBook Air (15インチ, M2, 2023)」と変わらず、ベースモデルもストレージが256GBからという構成になっているため、2022年から確認されている以下の問題が残っている可能性があります。
サーマルスロットリングによるピークパフォーマンス
Appleが2022年06月に開催したWWDC22の基調公園の中で発表した「MacBook Air (M2, 2022)」と「MacBook Pro (13-inch, M2, 2022)」はほぼ同じデザインながら、MacBook Airはファンレス仕様で、MacBook Proは冷却ファンを搭載しプロクラスのパフォーマンスが維持できるとコメントされていました。
実際、発売後のベンチマークテストでは、そのコメントの通り、MacBook Air/Proもピークパフォーマンスに関しては同じものの、3Dレンダリングを利用したCinebenchベンチマークなど長時間＆高負荷のワークロードを行うと、サーマルスロットリングがかかりMacBook Airの方がパフォーマンスが約25%低下しだし、
Xcodeベンチマークに関しても、MacBook Air (M2, 2022)でBuildドを続けると一瞬にしてサーマルリミットの105℃に達し、40%程度Build Timeが延び、最終的にはApple M1チップと冷却ファンを搭載したMacBook Pro以下の性能になっていました。
Apple M3シリーズチップを搭載したMacBook Pro (14/16インチ, Nov 2024)のXcodeベンチマークは こちら
この問題は、ヒートパイプ/シールが拡大されたMacBook Air (15インチ, M2, 2023)モデルで多少改善されたものの、Appleが何か対策を行っていなければ、Apple M3チップを搭載したMacBook Air (13インチ, 2024)も同様の傾向が見られると思われます。
ちなみに、Appleが公開したApple M3チップ搭載のMacBook Air (13インチ, M3, 2024)の消費電力情報によると、同モデルはアイドル時の消費電力が3.09Wと、旧モデルの13インチMacBook Air (M2, 2022)と変わらないそうです。
SSDのNAND数によるストレージ速度低下
Appleが公開したM3チップ搭載のMacBook Air (13/15インチ, M3, 2024)のベースモデルは、日本では値上がりしたMacBook Pro (14/16インチ, Nov 2023)とは異なり、13インチの価格が164,800円、15インチが198,800円と価格が据え置かれ、ストレージとメモリ構成もSSDが256GB,ユニファイドメモリが8GBと変わっていませんが、
Apple M3チップを搭載したMacBook Pro (14インチ, Nov 2023)では廃止された256GB SSDがMacBook Air (13/15インチ, M3, 2024)では引き続き採用されており、この256GB SSDは過去のMacBook Airと同じならばNANDチップが1枚の構成となっているため、
Apple M3と256GB SSDを搭載したMacBook Air (13/15インチ, M3, 2024)のベースモデルは、256GB NAND 2枚構成の512GBモデルと比較してWriteが15~30%、Readが40~50%ほど低い可能性があるため、予算が許すなら512GB SSDモデルを選択した方がいいと思われますが、
13インチの512GB SSDモデルは194,800円、15インチの512GB SSDモデルは228,800円と、Apple M3チップを搭載したMacBook Pro (14インチ, Nov 2023)の248,800円に迫ってくるので、M3チップ搭載のMacBookシリーズの選択は性能を取るか予算を取るかで悩みそうです。
ちなみに、Appleは一部のインフルエンサーとメディアにMacBook Air (13/15インチ, M3, 2024)のレビューユニットの提供を開始したそうなので、近く公開されるレビューを待ってから選択してもいいかもしれません。
FYI the new M3 MacBook Air only supports 2 external displays with the lid CLOSED. Weirdly, if you open the laptop to use the keyboard/trackpad, it turns off one of the external displays So if you plan on plugging into 2 screens you’ll also need to bring your own mouse + keyboard pic.twitter.com/8QlaB3CH8S — Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) March 4, 2024

Article title:  〈美股早盤〉那斯達克指數領跌 主要指數開低

Article maintext:  美股主要指數周二 (5 日) 開低，以科技股為主的那斯達克指數領跌，在本周一系列經濟數據包括聯準會 (Fed) 主席鮑爾出席國會作證在內的幾項關鍵事件之前，大型成長股下跌。
截稿前，道瓊工業指數跌逾 160 點或近 0.4%，那斯達克綜合指數跌逾 180 點或近 1.2%，標普 500 指數跌近 0.5%，費城半導體指數跌逾 1.3%。
隨著蘋果 (AAPL-US)、超微 (AMD-US)、特斯拉 (TSLA-US) 三大科技股下挫，美股盤前主要指數期貨走跌，交易商也在等待新一輪經濟數據，這將有助於影響聯準會 (Fed) 的政策前景。
蘋果 iPhone 在中國的困境加劇，而超微在向亞洲國家出售人工智慧 (AI) 晶片時遇到美國的障礙；特斯拉在中國的出貨量大幅下滑，導致股價進一步下滑。
美股前陣子反彈後失去了動力，此前反彈引發了人們對過高估值的擔憂——尤其是大型股，這讓大型股在面對壞消息時容易受到進一步波動的影響。
在 Fed 主席鮑爾本周向國會作證之前，交易員仍不願大舉押注，外界預估鮑爾將重申政策委員會的訊息，即不急於降息。
Sevens Report 創始人 Tom Essaye 表示：「隨著鮑爾明天即將發表證詞，隨著短期交易員從最近創下的歷史新高中獲利，市場緩慢波動或適度持續下跌可能在今天上演。」
截至台北時間周二（5 日）22 時許：
焦點個股：
蘋果 (AAPL-US) 早盤下跌 2.33%，至每股 171.02 美元
蘋果遭歐盟重罰 18 億歐元，主因蘋果的應用程式商店限制音樂串流程式開發者告知消費者在蘋果平台外有更便宜選擇，濫用市場主導地位。歐盟《數位市場法》（Digital Markets Act, DMA）本周四 (7 日) 正式上路，該法旨在避免大型網路平台壟斷市場，蘋果遭歐盟屢次調查的難關恐尚未結束。
超微 (AMD-US) 早盤下跌 1.44%，至每股 202.40 美元
超微 (AMD) 周二美股開盤前股價下跌逾 2%，此前彭博援引知情人士消息報導，該公司打算銷售專為中國市場設計的人工智慧 (AI) 晶片遭到美國政府阻礙，此舉為華府打擊對中國出口先進技術的一部分。
理想汽車 (NIO-US) 早盤下跌 1.03%，至每股 5.28 美元
中國電動車製造商蔚來汽車周二 (5 日) 美股盤前公布 2023 會計年度第四季與全年財報，儘管第四季虧損略有收窄，但預料今年第一季 (本季) 營收可能下滑。此外，由於中國電動車市場競爭越來越激烈，蔚來汽車去年虧損擴大。

美國 2 月 Markit 服務業 PMI 終值報 52.3，預期 51.3，前值 52.5
華爾街分析：
花旗集團策略師 Chris Montagu 表示，美國科技股的看漲部位達到三年來的最高水準，加大市場回檔的風險。他表示，那斯達克 100 指數期貨的多頭部位處於非常高的水平，而歐洲和日本日經指數的部位水平也有導致獲利回吐的很大風險。

Article title:  AI generativa Apple: Gli investitori dovrebbero aspettarsi una crescita dei ricavi

Article maintext:  Un’altra giornata, un altro episodio di Apple che alimenta la fiamma della crescita a Wall Street con le magiche due lettere: AI.
Advertising
Le dichiarazioni di Tim Cook durante l’assemblea degli azionisti riguardo all’innovazione di Apple nel campo dell’IA quest’anno erano destinate ad entusiasmare gli investitori. Secondo un analista, però, il mercato non è stato persuaso dalle promesse. Tuttavia, viene presentato il caso per cui gli investitori dovrebbero essere ottimisti riguardo alla crescita dei ricavi dell’azienda con l’intelligenza artificiale.
Nel frattempo, Apple ha trovato nuovi modi per promuovere i suoi chip esistenti utilizzando l’AI. Il termine AI, non la tecnologia, intendiamo.
Crescita alimentata dall’AI
Gene Munster, partner gestore presso Deepwater Asset Management, caratterizza il calo delle azioni AAPL di ieri come un voto di mancanza di fiducia degli investitori sulla strategia di AI di Apple:
“$AAPL è in calo del 3% perché gli investitori stanno votando per una limitata fiducia nella loro strategia di AI. Ormai è chiaro che a giugno vedremo il loro primo modello di base, qualcosa che competirà con GPT, Gemini, xAI, Anthropic. Quello che non è noto è cosa significhi un modello di base per il business di Apple?”
Tuttavia, Munster prevede che l’intelligenza artificiale di Apple abbia ancora il potenziale per far progredire il bilancio dal punto di vista dei ricavi:
“L’AI può spostare l’ago dei guadagni. Apple ha 2,2 miliardi di dispositivi attivi, che stimo siano di proprietà di 1,4 miliardi di utenti attivi. Se il 20% della base attiva di Apple sottoscrivesse un prodotto AI (AI personalizzata) a $10 al mese, sarebbero $33 miliardi l’anno in ricavi con un margine dell’80%, che aumenterebbe l’utile operativo del 16%. (155 miliardi di utile operativo nel 2023).”
Paragona la visione potenzialmente miope degli investitori a una situazione simile con Meta quando la prospettiva a lungo termine era fuori fuoco:
“L’andamento delle azioni AAPL di quest’anno mi ricorda un po’ quando nell’autunno del 2022 la preoccupazione degli investitori che Meta avrebbe perso quote a favore di TikTok ha messo sotto pressione il titolo a $100. Alla fine, questi prodotti (Meta, Google Search, Microsoft Office e Apple Services) sono persistenti a lungo termine.”
Hype per l’AI
Quindi, cosa possiamo aspettarci effettivamente da Apple nella categoria dell’AI quest’anno?
La scorsa settimana, Tim Cook ha affermato di credere che Apple “aprirà nuovi orizzonti” nell’AI generativa quest’anno. Alcune settimane prima, il CEO aveva promesso annunci sull’intelligenza artificiale di Apple che arriveranno più avanti quest’anno, probabilmente alla WWDC a giugno. È anche lì che sarà presentato iOS 18, su cui Mark Gurman di Bloomberg ha riferito frequentemente e che si concentrerà sulle funzionalità dell’AI.
E l’autunno scorso, Apple ha accennato brevemente all’AI generativa quando ha introdotto nuove funzioni di correzione automatica e predizione del testo su tutte le sue piattaforme.
L’intelligenza artificiale è da tempo al centro dell’attenzione dell’azienda. Negli ultimi anni, il colosso di Cupertino ha pubblicizzato il componente Neural Engine dei chip Apple silicon. Le funzioni che utilizzano il Neural Engine sono state definite come ML, o machine learning, ma Apple è al corrente del cambiamento del linguaggio.
AI
Proprio questa mattina, Apple ha rilasciato un comunicato stampa che descrive il MacBook Air M3 come il miglior laptop consumer per l’AI.
E Apple non sta facendo solo una semplice sostituzione da ML a AI. L’intelligenza artificiale generativa alimenta gli ultimi 12 mesi di hype sull’IA, e Cook ha specificamente menzionato questa funzionalità in recenti commenti.
Quindi, da un lato, abbiamo Apple che evidenzia funzionalità che non pensiamo veramente come AI dal momento che l’attenzione è stata catturata dall’AI generativa:
“Sfruttando questa incredibile performance AI, macOS offre funzionalità intelligenti che migliorano la produttività e la creatività, in modo che gli utenti possano abilitare potenti funzionalità della fotocamera, trascrizione del discorso in tempo reale, traduzione, previsioni di testo, comprensione visiva, funzionalità di accessibilità e molto altro.”
Ma c’è anche questo paragrafo:
“Con un vasto ecosistema di app che offrono funzionalità AI avanzate, gli utenti possono fare tutto, dal verificare i compiti con l’assistenza matematica AI in Goodnotes 6, all’ottimizzazione automatica delle foto in Pixelmator Pro, alla rimozione del rumore di fondo da un video utilizzando CapCut. In combinazione con l’architettura di memoria unificata di Apple silicon, il MacBook Air può eseguire anche modelli AI ottimizzati, inclusi grandi modelli linguistici (LLM) e modelli di diffusione per la generazione di immagini a livello locale con ottime prestazioni. Oltre alle prestazioni on-device, il MacBook Air supporta anche soluzioni basate su cloud, consentendo agli utenti di eseguire potenti app di produttività e creative che sfruttano la potenza dell’IA, come Microsoft Copilot per Microsoft 365, Canva e Adobe Firefly.”
Le aspettative sono alle stelle per iOS 18 e la WWDC 2024. Se vediamo più funzionalità simili a quelle già esistenti da parte di Apple, Wall Street non sarà impressionata. Ma se la società farà davvero la storia nell’AI generativa come categoria (e non solo per Apple), beh, forse la visione di crescita di Munster può essere realizzata. Chissà, forse a giugno staremo tutti creando app per Apple Vision Pro parlando con Siri.

Article maintext:  The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 has gone 303 trading sessions without a pullback of 2.5% or more, the third-longest stretch since 1990, according to Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG.

Article title:  Vendas de iPhone na China caem 24% com aumento da popularidade da Huawei

Article maintext:  As vendas do iPhone na China caíram 24% nas primeiras seis semanas de 2024 sobre o mesmo período do ano passado, de acordo com a empresa de pesquisa Counterpoint, com a Apple (AAPL34; AAPL) enfrentando aumento da concorrência de rivais chineses como a Huawei.
Principal concorrente da gigante de tecnologia dos EUA na China, a Huawei viu as vendas de seus smartphones saltarem 64% no período, de acordo com o levantamento.
Isso pode alimentar temores entre investidores de uma desaceleração na demanda da empresa norte-americana, cuja previsão de receita para o trimestre atual ficou 6 bilhões de dólares abaixo das expectativas de Wall Street.
As ações da Apple caíram 1,6% nas negociações de pré-mercado nesta terça-feira e perderam cerca de 10% de seu valor até agora este ano, com desempenho inferior ao de seus pares nos Estados Unidos.
De acordo com o relatório da Counterpoint, a participação da Apple no mercado chinês de smartphones caiu para 15,7%, colocando a empresa em quarto lugar em comparação com a segunda posição no mesmo período do ano passado, quando a fatia da companhia era de 19%.
A Huawei subiu para o segundo lugar, com participação de mercado de 16,5% ante 9,4% no ano passado. O mercado geral de smartphones na China encolheu 7% no período, segundo o relatório.
A Apple “enfrentou uma concorrência acirrada no segmento de alto padrão, ao mesmo tempo em que foi espremida no meio por preços agressivos de empresas como OPPO, Vivo e Xiaomi”, disse o analista sênior da Counterpoint, Mengmeng Zhang.
A Apple começou a subsidiar certos modelos de iPhone em até 1.300 iuans (180,68 dólares) na semana passada por meio da Tmall, a principal plataforma de marketplace do Alibaba.
A empresa já havia oferecido descontos para o iPhone de até 500 iuans em seus sites oficiais no mês passado.
A Huawei observou um ressurgimento nas vendas de seus smartphones premium desde que lançou a série Mate 60 em agosto.
A Honor, a marca de smartphones desmembrada da Huawei em 2020, foi a única outra marca entre as cinco principais na China a registrar aumento nas vendas unitárias durante as primeiras seis semanas do ano, com alta de 2%. As marcas chinesas Vivo, Xiaomi e Oppo caíram 15%, 7% e 29%, respectivamente, segundo o levantamento.

Article title:  5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Article maintext:  Target (TGT) shares were moving sharply higher in premarket trading Tuesday after the retailer reported strong quarterly results, while shares of Gitlab (GTLB) were tumbling as its guidance came in short of expectations. Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone sales in China, its biggest overseas market, have plunged to start the year, while Chinese officials have set an ambitious 5% annual economic growth target. U.S. stock futures are pointing lower, bitcoin is down after closing in on its high and gold is hovering near its all-time high. Here’s what investors need to know today.
1. Target Soars as Holiday-Quarter Earnings Beat Offsets Weak Sales Forecast
Target (TGT) shares surged more than 8% in premarket trading Tuesday after the retailer reported higher-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results and ended a streak of falling sales. The Minneapolis-based retailer said earnings per share for the holiday quarter ending Feb. 4 were $2.98, well above analysts’ forecasts of $2.41 a share, and almost 60% higher than the year before. Revenue gains were more modest, up 1.7% at $31.9 billion, but beat forecasts of $31.4 billion and also came after falling sales in the two previous quarters. The results offset weak guidance from the retailer, which said it expects current-quarter declines in sales of between 3% and 5%.
2. China Sets Ambitious 5% Annual Growth Target
China set an economic growth target of around 5% for the year, a goal economists say is ambitious and will require the nation to unleash more stimulus in a country battling a real estate downturn and deflation. This year’s goal, announced Tuesday by Premier Li Qiang at the start of the country’s annual legislative session, is higher than the International Monetary Fund's and World Bank’s estimates for Chinese growth this year, and same as last year’s target. Even with the post-Covid rebound last year, however, the government had to roll out a series of stimulative measures to meet its target.
3. Apple Falls as China Sales Keep Slumping, EU Fine Weighs
Apple (AAPL) shares fell more than 2% in premarket trading as market-research firm Counterpoint said iPhone sales in China, the company’s biggest overseas market, fell by 24% over the first six weeks of this year. The iPhone maker, which recently said its greater China sales in its December quarter were down 13%, has been rolling out rare discounts on its device in the country to pump up demand. The report comes a day after the European Union fined Apple about $2 billion saying the iPhone maker had violated antitrust rules by restricting app developers from telling users about alternative ways to subscribe to music-streaming services. Apple shares are down 6% this year, while Microsoft (MSFT), which is leading the artificial intelligence race through its ongoing partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, has overtaken it in terms of market value.
4. AMD Reportedly Fails to Get Clearance for China Chip Sales
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reportedly failed to make the artificial intelligence chip it tailored for the Chinese market weak enough to be sold without a license from the Commerce Department, dealing a setback for the chipmaker. AMD had hoped to receive a green light from the Commerce Department to sell the AI processor to Chinese customers as it performs at a lower level than what AMD sells outside of China, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the situation. AMD shares were off about 1.5%.
5. GitLab Plunges as Guidance Undershoots Expectations
GitLab (GTLB) shares plunged nearly 25% in premarket trading, after the software infrastructure company disappointed investors with weak full-year earnings guidance. The San Francisco-based company, which operates an open-source repository development platform for coders, said it expects full-year fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings of between 19 and 23 cents per share, with the high end of that forecast well below Wall Street’s expectations.

Article title:  Up 50% Over The Past Month Despite Mixed February Deliveries, What Lies Ahead For Li Auto Stock?

Article maintext:  Li Auto's new energy vehicles are being displayed in Yichang, Hubei Province, China, on February 28, ... [+] 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images
Chinese luxury electric vehicle maker Li Auto stock posted mixed delivery numbers for February, shipping 20,251 cars, down 35% from January, although it marks an increase of about 22% compared to last year. Automotive sales in China are usually weak in January and February, due to the extended Chinese New Year holiday, which impacts manufacturing and sales. Moreover, Li also faced a shortage of some trims of Li L series models (which combine electric drive trains with a gasoline-powered generator) as the company preps for upcoming refreshes. That said, Li appears to have fared better than its key rivals, Nio and Xpeng. Xpeng delivered 4,545 EVs for the month, down 44.9% from January, and down 24% from the year-ago period, while Nio delivered 8,132 cars in February, down 19% from January and down 33% from the year-ago period. Separately, Li Auto also launched its first full-electric model, a van called the MEGA, at 560,000 yuan (around $78,000). The price point was slightly higher than analysts had expected. Li stock declined about 7% in pre-market trading on Monday, but it remains up by about 50% over the past month.
LI stock has seen extremely strong gains of 50% from levels of $30 in early January 2021 to around $43 now, vs. an increase of about 35% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the increase in LI stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 11% in 2021, -36% in 2022, and 83% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that LI underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Consumer Discretionary sector including AMZN, TSLA, and TM, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could LI face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?
There are concerns about global EV demand, with most mainstream automakers seeing tepid demand and scaling back on their electrification goals. For instance, Mercedes-Benz dialed back on its target of going all-electric by 2030, now estimating that only 50% of total sales would be EVs. We’ve seen similar production scalebacks from the likes of Ford as well. While the Chinese EV market is poised to post double-digit growth this year, competition and price wars are mounting. However, Li’s highly differentiated vehicles appear to be giving it an edge in the market. Unlike rivals who have seen margin compression in 2023, Li’s margins have been improving. Li posted automotive gross margins of 22.7% in Q4 2023, compared to about 20% in the year-ago period. The company also remains positive about its delivery outlook, guiding 50,000 vehicles in March, up almost 2.5x compared to the previous year. The company previously noted that was targeting sales of 800,000 vehicles for 2024, a growth of more than 2x versus 2023. Now, Li stock trades at about $43 per share, about 26x consensus 2024 earnings and 17x 2025 earnings, which is not very expensive considering that the company’s revenues are projected to grow by over 60% this year and by over 30% next year.

Article title:  〈美股盤後〉科技股賣壓襲來 道瓊狂瀉逾400點 那指創三周來最糟單日表現

Article maintext:  受蘋果 (AAPL-US) 在內大型科技股拖累，大盤持續遠離近期創下的紀錄高點，道瓊指數周二 (5 日) 收盤崩跌超過 400 點，那指也重挫逾 1.6%，單日表現為三周以來最糟。
蘋果周二收盤下跌 2.8%，至 10 月以來最低水平，受資訊科技板塊拖累，標普 500 指數終場跌約 1%，Netflix(NFLX-US) 和微軟 (MSFT-US) 等幾檔大型科技股跌幅均逼近 3%，特斯拉 (TSLA-US) 跌近 4%，過去兩天累計跌幅超過 11%。
包含蘋果、微軟、輝達、亞馬遜、Meta、Alphabet 和特斯拉在內的「七大科技股」(Magnificent Seven)，帶動標普 500 指數在今年登上歷史新高，部分源自於對人工智慧 (AI) 的熱情，強勁的漲勢促使策略師紛紛調高 2024 年的目標價，但也引發科技股是否過度繁榮的疑慮。
此外，超微 (AMD-US) 向中國出售客製化 AI 晶片受阻的消息，連帶拖累其他晶片股，費半終場挫跌逾 2%。
華爾街同時評估美國服務業活動降溫的最新證據。美國 2 月 ISM 非製造業指數自 1 月的 53.4 降至 52.6，降幅超出市場預期，不過仍繼續處在擴張區間。另一方面，因波音客機合約減少，1 月工廠訂單下滑了 3.6%。
在聯準會 (Fed) 主席鮑爾 (Jerome Powell) 赴國會作證與最新非農數據出爐之前，投資人也保持謹慎。周五的非農數據應為市場提供更多有關 Fed 利率路徑和經濟健康狀況的線索。
根據芝商所 (CME Group) 的 FedWatch 工具，交易員預估今年 6 月首次降息的機率為 67.2%。
其他政經消息面，為化解中國應用程式帶來的國安疑慮，美國兩黨議員周二提出立法，要求 TikTok 母公司字節跳動 (ByteDance) 在約六個月的時間內分拆 TikTok 業務，否則將面臨美國祭出的禁令，預計國會將於周四 (7 日) 進行初步表決。

華爾街分析
花旗集團 (Citigroup) 的 Chris Montagu 表示，美股科技股的看多部位正處三年來最高水平，這提高了修正風險。SlateStone Wealth 的 Kenny Polcari 也說，部分投資人開始擔憂，這些科技公司是否不會辜負投資人給予它們的高估值。
摩根大通 (JPMorgan) 的 Marko Kolanovic 認為，美股和比特幣大幅走高，預示著泡沫正在累積。不過，高盛 (Goldman Sachs) 的 David Kostin 則認為，大型科技公司的高估值受到基本面所支撐。
The Sevens Report 創辦人 Tom Essaye 稱：「人工智慧熱潮是現代淘金熱，隨著企業採購晶片和雲端空間來促進此一繁榮，科技公司的獲利正呈現爆炸式成長。倘若 AI 無法在未來幾年提高標普 500 指數其他成份股公司的獲利能力，對 AI 晶片的需求將會消失，與 AI 相關的雲端需求也會消失。」
瑞銀全球財富管理 (UBS Global Wealth Management) 分析師 Solita Marcelli 表示：「雖然我們認為當前科技股還有進一步上漲空間，投資人仍應評估並優化對科技股的投資，以防股價下跌的可能性，並從大型科技股以外的機會中獲益。」

Article title:  Apple iPhone Sales Plunge in China

Article maintext:  China is the largest smartphone market in the world. Approximately 900 million people own them. It is also the battlefield for global sales because of its size and the number of large competitors. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has done well with iPhone sales in China for years, but its fortunes took a considerable turn for the worse at the start of this year.

Article title:  Apple's China iPhone Sales Plunge 24% in First Six Weeks of Year

Article maintext:  KEY TAKEAWAYS Sales in China, Apple's largest overseas market, dropped 24% in the first six weeks of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, according to market research firm Counterpoint.
The iPhone maker's market share in China slipped to 16% in 2024, falling to fourth place from second place in 2023, when it had a 19% share.
Major Chinese retailers are offering the iPhone 15, launched only five months ago, at discounted prices to stimulate demand.
Apple’s (AAPL) sales of iPhones in China, its biggest overseas market, fell by 24% over the first six weeks of this year, according to market research firm Counterpoint.
The data follows Apple's disclosure last month that its Greater China sales during the fiscal first quarter fell 13%. Apple has been rolling out discounts to pump up demand.
The top spot in the country at 18% market share went to domestic budget phone maker Vivo, while Apple's main competitor for high-end phones in the country is another Chinese firm, Huawei, which increased to 17% market share from 9% last year. Led by its Mate 60 series, Huawei's sales surged 64% over the period to become the second-largest seller in China, and aggressive pricing from OPPO, Vivo, and Xiaomi squeezed Apple's mid-range offerings, according to Counterpoint.
The iPhone maker's market share in China fell to 16% in 2024, falling to fourth place from second place in 2023, when it had a 19% share. Chinese retail giants JD.com, TMall, and Pinduoduo are offering steep discounts on Apple's iPhone 15 just five months after launch to generate demand.
The plunging Chinese sales are another hit for Apple, which faces one of the largest-ever European Union antitrust fines. The European Commission fined Apple around $2 billion for violating antitrust rules through "abusive App store rules for music streaming providers."
Apple shares were down more than 2% in premarket trading Tuesday.

Article title:  The “Uncle Indicator” Screams Sell!?

Article maintext:  The “Uncle Indicator” Screams Sell!?
The bears are giving up.
No one’s betting against the raging rally anymore as the mega-cap tech leaders continue to climb to new highs.
The YOLO crew is back to making huge, bullish bets on earnings and loading up on speculative options buys. As stocks continue to squeeze higher, these speculators are cashing in on their wild, out-of-the money calls. Let the good times roll!
Just how frothy is it getting out there?
For starters, the put/call ratio is hitting extreme levels. The folks at Barchart noted that on March 1, the total put/call ratio dropped to its lowest level since late 2021. In other words, no one is paying for downside protection. The stocks only go up mentality is back with a vengeance as speculators flood back into their favorite trade – semiconductors, tech-growth stocks, and crypto.
Even worse, I’m hearing stories left and right about everyone’s personal contra-friend calling them up and asking about the latest semiconductor that’s going parabolic…
That’s another uncle indicator flashing bright red. The previous cycle’s biggest bagholders are back to revenge-trade their favorite stocks and alt-coins.
But before you log onto your brokerage account and short every high-flying stock in sight, it’s important I mention that we’re probably not headed for a nasty crash. Sure, some of these ridiculous rallies could use a hard reset. But we’re probably too early in the bull market cycle for a catastrophic plunge. Too many stocks are exhibiting strength, and the list of names making new lows is virtually nonexistent.
Market breadth simply isn’t an issue right now. Typically, fewer and fewer leading stocks will prop up a bull market that’s on its last legs. Today, we’re seeing the exact opposite: more stocks joining the party and rallying along with NVDA and the other high-profile leaders.
Instead of an impending crash due to a top-heavy market, we’re seeing the beginnings of a rotation away from mega-caps into tech laggards and small-cap stocks – a rotation that has become more pronounced over the past week.
Anatomy of a Rotation
It hasn’t been perfect. But after a few false starts, this bull market rotation is materializing.
During these rotation events, the market’s strongest stocks consolidate or retreat as other stocks and sectors begin to outperform and take on new leadership roles. If you learn how to spot and take advantage of these rotations, you’ll find that you can grab onto emerging trends and ride them to fresh highs as they begin to dominate the market.
The next rotation will begin with a much-needed reset of the mega-cap stocks – names like NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and Meta Platforms Inc. (META) will stop going up every single day.
Yes, a few of these stocks – most notably Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) – have already started to fade from their highs. But the other leading mega-caps haven’t lost a step this year. They’ve shrugged off extreme overbought conditions and continue to surge higher.
I’ve been chirping about these soaring market leaders since late last year – watching and waiting for a hard reset that has yet to materialize. And I’m not the only one talking about this top-heavy market. Nearly every major analyst has mentioned the dominant mega-caps as a potential concern going back to early 2023.
But the stock market doesn’t care what anyone thinks. I told you in December that I did not believe the leading mega-caps were going to experience the same level of market domination in 2024. NVDA probably isn’t going to rally another 250%, I noted, adding that the stock probably won’t crash, yet would fall short of its historic 2023 performance.
Yet here we are – just two full months into the year and NVDA has already gained almost 70%.
If you were around in 1999-2000, this mad dash for tech might look familiar. But you don’t even have to look back 25 years to find similar conditions. If you were paying attention during the Covid Bubble in early 2021, you can probably spot the similarities.
Not only would a rotation into different leadership allow these out-of-control shares to chill out for a bit – it would also be incredibly healthy for the market at-large.
Where Does the Hot Money Go Next?
When the streaking semis finally get doused with a bucket of cold water, which stocks could pick up the baton and start running?
You don’t have to blindly guess where the gains will come from – because we’re already seeing key breakouts emerge in some forgotten corners of the market.
Just look at small-caps…
The Russell 2000 has snapped out of its stupor and broken above its December highs following a rocky start to 2024. It’s now green on the year and working on playing catch-up with the major averages:
Keep in mind, the Russell 2000 has grossly underperformed the major averages for nearly two years. The Russell was hit hard by the regional banking crisis in early 2023. It also failed to rally with the major averages into the summer months, leading to a hard reset that lasted from August through October.
Most mega-caps were stable during this period while smaller names took a beating, acting as a safe haven for investors worried about the potential for a bigger drawdown heading into the fourth quarter. When the big move lower failed to materialize and the melt-up rally ignited, the Russell flipped its switch and posted a 20% move off its lows.
Now, IWM has completed a base breakout and is just a few bucks away from new two-year highs, erasing much of its bear market drawdown. If the rotation theme continues to play out, we could see the smaller stocks outpace the big boys – even as the major averages take a break.
Small-caps aren’t the only rotation stocks in play this week.
Gold is breaking out…
Energy is heating up, too…
You don’t have to chase big tech to find great trades in this market. Just keep an eye on the charts and try your best to suppress the FOMO as the semis fly directly into the sun.

Article title:  Apple Is The 1st US Big Tech Company To Be Hit By An EU Antitrust Fine

Article maintext:  The European Union’s executive branch, the European Commission, has hit Apple (AAPL) with a nearly $2 billion fine resulting from a complaint from Spotify, marking the E.U.’s first-ever antitrust penalty on the U.S. tech giant. The E.U.’s antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager wrote remarks yesterday (Mar. 4) explaining the decision, stating that Apple is “abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.” According to the European Commission, Apple, which has its own music streaming service, Apple Music, prevents competing apps like Spotify from informing users of their different pricing tiers in subscriptions options.

“For a decade, Apple has restricted music streaming app developers from informing their consumers about cheaper options available outside of the app,” Vestager said in her statement. “Apple has done so by contractually imposing ‘anti-steering rules’ on music streaming app developers.”
In January, Spotify published an open letter to Vestager calling for the European Commission to take a stance against “anticompetitive and unfair practices” by Apple. Spotify first complained about Apple to E.U. regulators in 2019, saying the iPhone maker’s App Store failed to inform customers of different payment options provided by Spotify and other Apple competitors. Spotify also took issue with Apple taking a 30 percent cut from subscriptions purchased in the App Store.
In a statement today, Apple argued that Spotify, which is headquartered in Sweden, owns more than half of Europe’s music streaming market and that it doesn’t pay Apple for its use of the App Store, since users buy subscriptions through Spoitfy’s website.
“The reality is that European consumers have more choices than ever,” Apple said in its statement. “Ironically, in the name of competition, today’s decision just cements the dominant position of a successful European company that is the digital music market’s runaway leader.”
Apple is one of six tech companies designated as “gatekeepers” under the E.U.’s new Digital Markets Act. The designation is designed to identify large tech companies that have the potential to gain too much power in the digital market. The other five companies are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok parent ByteDance.
The DMA is set to take effect this week, and the designated companies will have until March 6 to comply with the regulations. Apple acknowledged the timeframe in its statement, promising it will act in accordance with the policy, but saying the $2 billion fine is a premature extension of the legislation. “What’s clear is that this decision is not grounded in existing competition law,” Apple said. “It’s an effort by the Commission to enforce the DMA before the DMA becomes law.”

Article title:  Berkshire Hathaway tiene 168,000 mdd en efectivo: estas acciones deberían estar en la lista de compras de Buffett

Article maintext:  Berkshire Hathaway es reconocida como la firma de gestión de inversiones más exitosa en las seis décadas desde que Warren Buffett compró un negocio textil en dificultades en New Bedford, Massachusetts, en 1965 y lo convirtió en un holding para una colección de inversiones tremendamente rentables.
Los retornos de inversión se han compuesto a más del 19% anual desde que Buffett siguió el consejo de su amigo y eventual socio comercial Charles Munger para modificar su enfoque de inversión de una estrategia de puro valor a una que se centrara más en la consistencia.
Munger falleció en noviembre a la edad de 99 años, y Buffett en su carta anual a los accionistas del mes pasado rindió homenaje a la influencia beneficiosa de su lugarteniente de toda la vida y asesor de inversiones, especialmente después de que compró el negocio textil Berkshire Hathaway.
“Charlie, en 1965, me aconsejó rápidamente: ‘Warren, olvídate de volver a comprar una compañía como Berkshire, pero ahora que controlas Berkshire, agrégale negocios maravillosos comprados a precios justos y deja de comprar negocios justos a precios maravillosos. En otras palabras, abandona todo lo que aprendiste de tu héroe, Ben Graham. Funciona, pero solo cuando se practica a pequeña escala’.
Mantener pacientemente participaciones en empresas de alta calidad como Coca-Cola (KO), American Express (AXP) y Apple (AAPL) durante largos períodos de tiempo ha dado resultados muy positivos. La propiedad total de Berkshire Hathaway de compañías como Geico, Burlington Northern Santa Fe y See’s Candy ha acumulado enormes cantidades de efectivo.
“En Berkshire, particularmente favorecemos a las empresas excepcionales que pueden desplegar capital adicional a retornos altos en el futuro”, escribe Buffett. “Ser propietario de solo una de estas empresas y simplemente quedarse quieto puede generar riqueza casi incalculable”.
A fines de 2023, Berkshire Hathaway, dirigida por Buffett de 93 años, tenía 167,600 millones de dólares (mdd) en efectivo y equivalentes de efectivo, lo que representa el 31% de los fondos totales disponibles para inversión de la firma con sede en Omaha, que incluye 370,000 millones en acciones.
Buffett no practica la sincronización del mercado ni se dedica a la predicción económica, pero su perspectiva del mercado se puede deducir del apetito comprador de Berkshire, que vendió más acciones de las que compró el año pasado, lo que ayudó a aumentar su nivel de efectivo en un 30% desde los 128,500 millones a fines de 2022.
“Creo que es menos una perspectiva del mercado y más un comentario sobre la valoración del mercado, porque Buffett es increíblemente sensible a la valoración”, dice Meyer Shields, quien sigue a Berkshire Hathaway y otras compañías en la industria de seguros en Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Buffett reconoce en su carta actual a los accionistas que su compañía tiene efectivo “muy por encima de lo que la sabiduría convencional considera necesario”, pero explicó que tal prudencia siempre ha sido parte del plan y está muy en línea con su disciplina de inversión. “El conservadurismo fiscal extremo es un compromiso corporativo que hacemos con aquellos que se han unido a nosotros en la propiedad de Berkshire”, escribe Buffett. “En la mayoría de los años, de hecho, en la mayoría de las décadas, es probable que nuestra cautela resulte ser un comportamiento innecesario, similar a una póliza de seguro en un edificio similar a una fortaleza que se cree a prueba de fuego”.
Una cartera de acciones con un 31% en efectivo podría representar una asignación defensiva para muchos inversionistas individuales, pero para un gestor de inversiones como Buffett, los fondos inactivos representan toneladas de pólvora seca lista para desplegarse en acciones que pasen la prueba. Con el historial de cartera de Berkshire Hathaway bien documentado a lo largo de 59 años y la transparencia de Buffett al compartir sus pensamientos, no faltan pistas para seguir el rastro de dónde Berkshire podría estar buscando nuevas oportunidades de propiedad.
“Queremos ser dueños de la totalidad o de una parte de negocios que gocen de una buena economía, fundamental y duradera”, escribió Buffett en su carta anual publicada a fines de febrero.
Convertir la filosofía de inversión del “Oráculo de Omaha” en un sistema para seleccionar acciones duraderas requiere definir qué hace que un negocio sea maravilloso y un precio justo en términos de características específicas
GANGAS AL ESTILO BUFFETT
¿Qué hará Berkshire Hathaway con todo ese efectivo? A continuación, presentamos algunos candidatos sólidos con fundamentos adecuados.
Compañía Capitalización de mercado (en miles de millones) Rendimiento de Dividendos Ratio P/E Retorno sobre el Patrimonio Retorno sobre los Activos Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) US$390.9 3.0% 15.2 31.6% 13.6% Home Depot (HD) US$382.3 2.4% 25.0 1144.3% 19.3% Procter & Gamble (PG) US$374.1 2.4% 24.6 30.0% 13.3% Merck & Co.

“¿Qué tres cosas esenciales hacen que una acción sea adecuada para Berkshire?”, dice Charles Rotblut, quien dirige la investigación en la Asociación Estadounidense de Inversores Individuales y es editor de la revista AAII. “Un criterio es que tenga una valoración razonable, dos es que sea rentable con un alto rendimiento sobre el patrimonio y los activos, y tres es la consistencia en los márgenes de beneficio y flujo de caja”.
Mirando el portfolio actual de Berkshire, Apple presume un retorno sobre el capital del 160% y un retorno sobre los activos del 29%, razones importantes por las que representa el 45% de la inversión de Berkshire en acciones ordinarias y ha sido su mayor holding desde 2019. El 45% restante del portfolio lo constituyen las siguientes 10 tenencias más grandes, que incluyen compañías icónicas como Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola, Chevron, Occidental Petroleum y Kraft Heinz.
“La acción tradicional de Buffett es una compañía líder en la industria de gran capitalización dirigida por personas capaces, porque Buffett ha demostrado que no le gusta despedir a la gerencia e involucrarse en una situación de cambio radical”, dice Vahan Janjigian, director de inversiones de Greenwich Wealth Management (con activos de 2,000 millones) y autor de “Incluso Buffett No Es Perfecto”.
A pesar de una evasión de larga data de las acciones tecnológicas, Berkshire poseía acciones de IBM y soportó una experiencia destructiva de riqueza desde 2011 hasta que la eliminó del portfolio en 2018. Sin embargo, no se compadezca de Buffett, porque su siguiente incursión importante en el sector tecnológico fue cuando Berkshire comenzó a comprar Apple en 2016, convirtiéndose en su tenencia más valiosa tres años después. Ahora IBM parece estar saliendo de su bache, con ingresos en aumento en cada uno de los últimos tres años.

Berkshire Hathaway tiene 168,000 mdd en efectivo: estas acciones deberían estar en la lista de compras de Buffett
Janjigian dice que IBM y varias acciones de gran capitalización parecen ser excelentes candidatas para las próximas compras de Buffett: Home Depot y Procter & Gamble, así como los grandes nombres farmacéuticos AbbVie, Merck y Johnson & Johnson.
“Buffett ha mostrado una preferencia por las empresas que pagan buenos dividendos y los aumentan a tasas estables, por lo que estas acciones tendrían mucho sentido en el portfolio de Berkshire”.
Dado su profundo conocimiento y aprecio por la industria derivado de su propiedad de Geico, los seguros son otra área en la que es probable que Buffett esté buscando oportunidades. Berkshire recién el año pasado abandonó a Marsh McLennan, pero aún mantiene participaciones en Aon y Insurance Australia Group.
“No todas las compañías de seguros son excelentes, y Buffett ha criticado apropiadamente a los competidores de Geico que persiguen el rendimiento sobre primas a expensas de las ganancias de suscripción”, dice Shields de KBW. “Sin embargo, hay una serie de compañías de alta calidad que vale la pena considerar, y Chubb es el ejemplo más obvio de una compañía muy grande y muy bien administrada en el sector especializado”, continúa. “Destacaría a Progressive en el sector personal, y a Cincinnati Financial y Selective Insurance Group en el sector comercial, porque son compañías que han dominado la ciencia del trato amable a agentes y clientes, junto con el análisis necesario para sobrevivir”.
Si bien la acción estereotipada de Buffett es una empresa pagadora de dividendos bien establecida con una participación de mercado dominante, el 31% de las acciones de Berkshire no pagan dividendos, pero sí muestran otras características deseables que las hacen atractivas. Las tenencias actuales que no pagan efectivo a los accionistas incluyen Visa, Mastercard, Davita, Verisign y Amazon.
Los resultados de una selección de acciones de “Buffettología” en AAII.com presentan varias acciones que serían usos atractivos para parte del exceso de efectivo de Berkshire. Una de ellas es Ulta Beauty, el minorista de belleza especializado más grande del país, que ofrece un tentador retorno sobre el patrimonio del 62% y un retorno sobre los activos del 23%, junto con un crecimiento anual de las ganancias del 22% desde 2018.
La empresa de transporte con sede en Carolina del Norte, Old Dominion Freight Line, es la segunda transportista más grande de EE. UU. y cuenta con un retorno sobre el patrimonio del 32% y un retorno sobre los activos del 24%. Las ganancias han crecido un 18% anual durante los últimos cinco años.
Winnebago Industries, con sede en Minnesota, es un gigante en la industria de casas rodantes, con un crecimiento de las ganancias del 14% anual desde 2018. Winnebago, que tuvo ingresos de 3,430 millones en 2023, ofrece un rendimiento de dividendos del 1.7% y un retorno sobre el patrimonio del 13.5%.

Article title:  Google Announces Changes for EU Users to Comply With the DMA

Article maintext:  Key Takeaways Google said it is making changes for users in the European Union (EU) to comply with new laws for big tech companies that are meant to make the digital market more competitive.
The changes will affect users and app developers using Google services including search, Google Chrome browser, and the Google Play app store, among other features.
Under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the EU designated Google along with other tech giants as a "gatekeeper" that must comply with the DMA requirements by Wednesday.
Bank of America analysts said that Bumble, Match Group, Pinterest, and Snap could be beneficiaries of big tech companies' changes to comply with the DMA rules.
Some travel companies previously voiced concerns that changes may not remedy Google's preferential treatment of its services compared to competitors.
Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google said Tuesday it is making changes affecting users in the European Union (EU) to comply with new laws aimed at big tech companies to make the digital market more competitive.
The changes will affect search results, add a "choice screen" to make switching search engines and browsers easier, and eliminate some features like Google Flights. There will also be additional consents to share data across Google products to link services, the company said.
Updates will make it easier to download third-party apps and app stores as well, access alternative billing options outside of Google Play, and offer developers additional options to promote external offerings beyond the app.
Google has been rolling out changes to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Under the DMA, the EU named Google, Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), among others, as "gatekeepers" that must comply with the European Commission's requirements by Wednesday.
Bank of America analysts noted that "potential beneficiaries" of changes made by gatekeepers to comply with the DMA could include Bumble (BMBL), Match Group (MTCH), Pinterest (PINS), and Snap (SNAP).
The analysts said that "Google Chrome browser changes could be positive for ad tech companies such as DV and IAS, and headwinds eCommerce and media companies that rely on user targeting including Beyond, Meta, Snap, and Wayfair."
Ahead of Google's announcement of its latest changes, several travel companies had voiced concerns that Google's adjustments to comply with the DMA could reinforce its dominance rather than make the space more competitive.
Yelp (YELP) had said last week that Google's changes, which were first introduced in February, could "exacerbate the search giant’s self-preferencing."
EU Travel Tech, a group focused on promoting the interest of travel distributors to European policymakers and whose members include Airbnb (ABNB), Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP), and Booking (BKNG), also raised concerns. EU Travel Tech said that the organization "urge[s] Google to put an end to the preferential treatment of its own services against those of its competitors."
Shares of Google parent Alphabet were 1.4% lower as of about 11:30 a.m. ET Tuesday at $132.43. The stock has gained more than 38% in the past year.

Article title:  「科技七雄」單日總市值蒸發2330億美元 分析師：為修正非恐慌拋售

Article maintext:  近月來支撐股市走強的「科技七雄」(Magnificent Seven)，周二 (5 日) 市值蒸發 2330 億美元，加劇美股跌勢。不過，分析師認為這是牛市修正，並非恐慌性拋售。
周二收盤，蘋果 (AAPL-US) 下跌 2.8%，亞馬遜 (AMZN-US) 跌近 2%，微軟 (MSFT-US) 跌 3%，Google 母公司 Alphabet(GOOGL-US)、Meta(META-US) 和特斯拉 (TSLA-US) 分別收低 0.5%、1.6% 和 3.9%。在這七檔熱門的科技股中，僅輝達 (NVDA-US) 獨自收紅，終場漲近 0.9%。
Dow Jones Market Data 指出，周二的慘烈跌勢，導致科技七雄單日市值縮水幅度創下今年以來第三大，最大的是在 1 月 31 日的 3750 億美元。
Silvant Capital Management 投資長 Michael Sansoterra 說：「這並非恐慌性拋售。隨著股市近期創下一連串紀錄，那些稍微領先大盤的股票出現修正並不令人意外。」Sansoterra 認為，這只是今年強勁牛市中的正常走勢。
道瓊指數周二收盤下跌 404 點或 1%，標普 500 指數跌約 1%，那斯達克綜合指數則跌 1.7%。
聯準會 (Fed) 主席鮑爾周三起將連續兩天赴國會作證，投資人迫切希望聽到更多有關 Fed 轉向降息的計畫。
Fed 官員一再表示，他們不急於提早或激進扭轉升息政策，且當前通膨率仍高於央行設立的 2% 目標。官員們的發言令投資人調整今年可能降息的預期時間和降息幅度。
投資人也將於周五迎來 2 月非農就業報告。即使 Fed 為了對抗通膨，將短期利率維持在 22 年高點，美國勞動力市場和經濟依舊保持驚人韌性。

Article title:  Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway holds the key for Apple stock

Article maintext:  Apple stock, now mired at its lowest level in four months, has faced a cascade of challenges this year – and it may have another one if Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway really starts selling.
Karishma Vanjani for Barron’s:
‎
Warren Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire, has been one of Apple’s biggest backers. It owns a 5.9% stake, ranking behind only Vanguard Group, which holds 8.1% through its many mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, according to FactSet.
Based on Apple’s current share price, which had fallen for five consecutive trading sessions, including Tuesday morning, Berkshire’s stake in Apple is now worth $159 billion. It was valued at $167 billion in mid-February.
Apple stock, which still makes up about half of Berkshire’s equity portfolio, has come under pressure on a variety of fronts. The company has yet to offer detailed plans on an artificial-intelligence strategy and fewer iPhones are being sold in China, hurting overall revenue growth. A European Commission fine of nearly $2 billion over what it calls “abusive App Store rules,” disclosed Monday, isn’t good news either.
The next problem for the stock could be if Buffett sells more Apple. “I could see him selling sooner or later,” Mizuho analyst Daniel O’Regan wrote in a Tuesday research note. “In fact, I would not be surprised if he is selling right now.”
The next 13-F from Berkshire, showing its holdings as of the end of the first quarter, is due around May 15.

Article title:  Apple、iPhone 8/Xや初代iPad Pro/iPad (第5世代)など向けにゼロデイ脆弱性を修正した「iOS/iPadOS 16.7.6」をリリース。

Article maintext:  AppleがiPhone 8/Xや初代iPad Pro/iPad (第5世代)など向けにゼロデイ脆弱性を修正した「iOS/iPadOS 16.7.6」をリリースしています。詳細は以下から。
Appleは現地時間2024年03月05日、最新のiOS/iPadOSとなる「iOS/iPadOS 17.4 (21E219)」をiPhoneやiPadへリリースしましたが、同時にiOS 17のシステム要件から外れたiPhone 8やX、初代iPad Proなどに向けて「iOS/iPadOS 16.7.6 (20H320)」をリリースしています。
このアップデートには重要なバグ修正とセキュリティアップデートが含まれ、すべてのユーザに推奨されます。 リリースノートより
Appleが公開したセキュリティコンテンツによると、iOS/iPadOS 16.7.6ではCVEベースで1件の脆弱性が修正されており、iOS/iPadOS 17.4と同じく、悪意のある攻撃者がカーネルのメモリ保護をバイパスして情報を読み書きできる脆弱性(CVE-2024-23225)が修正されており、
この脆弱性に関しては、Appleも既に悪用されているという可能性があるという報告を受けているゼロデイ脆弱性となっているそうです。また、Appleは、この脆弱性の発見者を公表しておらず、脆弱性に関するエントリーを今後追加するとも記載しているので、iOS/iPadOS 16.7.6では現在のところ公表できない脆弱性の修正が含まれているようです。
Kernel
Available for: iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad 5th generation, iPad Pro 9.7-inch, and iPad Pro 12.9-inch 1st generation
Impact: An attacker with arbitrary kernel read and write capability may be able to bypass kernel memory protections. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited.

このアップデートには重要なバグ修正が含まれ、すべてのユーザに推奨されます。 リリースノートより
iOS 15.8.2のリリースノートには「重要なバグが修正された」としか記載されておらず、セキュリティ情報でもiOS/iPadOS 15.8.2には修正された脆弱性(CVEエントリー)はないと記載されているので、現在のところ何が修正されたかは不明ですが、
同時に公開された「iOS/iPadOS 16.7.6」には、今後公開予定の脆弱性の情報があると記載されていたので、iOS/iPadOS 15.8.2では現在のところ公表できない脆弱性が修正されているかもしれません。

Article title:  Wall Street recua com Nasdaq na liderança da queda, com baixa de papéis de megacapitalização e chips

Article maintext:  Os três principais índices de Wall Street recuaram mais de 1% nesta terça-feira, com a fraqueza das empresas de megacapitalização, como a Apple (AAPL34; AAPL), e o setor de chips pressionando o índice de tecnologia Nasdaq, antes da divulgação de uma série de dados econômicos nesta semana e de comentários do chair do Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, perante o Congresso norte-americano.
Os dados econômicos de terça-feira foram mistos, mostrando um crescimento mais lento do setor de serviços dos Estados Unidos em fevereiro, com o emprego diminuindo, enquanto uma medida de novas encomendas cresceu para o nível mais alto em seis meses, sinalizando a força subjacente do setor.
Alguns estrategistas viram as vendas generalizadas do setor de tecnologia nesta terça-feira como o resultado da realização de lucros para um setor que havia avançado recentemente depois de subir 56% em 2023.
“Talvez algumas pessoas estejam tirando as fichas da mesa, realizando alguns lucros, em conjunto com o que provavelmente é um nervosismo justificado antes de Powell falar e antes de obtermos a grande quantidade de dados do mercado de trabalho”, disse Kevin Gordon, estrategista sênior de investimentos da Charles Schwab.
As ações da Apple terminaram em queda de 2,8%, depois que um relatório de pesquisa mostrou que as vendas do iPhone na China caíram 24% em relação ao ano anterior nas primeiras seis semanas de 2024, uma vez que a Apple enfrentou o aumento da concorrência de rivais nacionais, como a Huawei.
O Dow Jones (DJI) caiu 1,04%, para 38.585,19 pontos. O S&P 500 (SPX) perdeu 1,02%, para 5.078,65 pontos. O Nasdaq (US100) caiu 1,65%, para 15.939,59 pontos.
Oito dos 11 principais índices setoriais do S&P 500 caíram, com o setor de tecnologia em queda de 1,2% e o de consumo discricionário em baixa de 1,3%.
O setor de energia, com alta de 0,7%, foi o que mais ganhou, seguido pelo de bens de consumo básicos, que subiu 0,3%.

The S&P 500 and the Dow fell 1.0% on the day. The Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as Apple's news and uncertainties around interest rate cuts pressured the tech sector.
Shares of Albemarle (ALB) suffered the steepest daily losses on the S&P 500, plummeting 17.9% after the world's largest lithium producer announced it would raise capital with a public offering of depository shares valued at $1.75 billion. Albemarle plans to use the proceeds to fund capital expenditures, including investments in its Australia and China operations.
After jumping to a 52-week high during the previous session, shares of semiconductor firm Qorvo (QRVO) dropped 5.8% on Tuesday. While Qorvo sees solid demand in its defense, aerospace, power management, WIFI, smartphone, and automotive markets, softness in its cellular base station business has restrained revenue growth.
The bleary day in the tech sector extended to chip stocks that have exploded higher recently amid enthusiasm about an impending artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) sank more than 2%, and shares of industry giant Intel (INTC) turned in the day's weakest performance on the Dow, falling 5.4%.
A strong set of results from the critical holiday quarter helped lift shares of Target (TGT) 12.0%, marking the S&P 500's strongest daily performance. In addition to beating earnings estimates, the retailer forecast better-than-expected comparable store sales growth for the full year. The company also plans to open 300 new stores in the U.S. and will launch its Target Circle 360 membership program in April.
Shares of kidney care company DaVita (DVA) jumped 7.1% after Novo Nordisk (NVO) revealed that its blockbuster weight-loss drug Ozempic had only limited benefits in reducing the risk of death for patients with chronic kidney disease. The news suggests that dialysis machines manufactured by DaVita to treat the condition will likely remain in demand.
Regional bank stocks advanced on Tuesday, recovering from losses posted last week after New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) disclosed issues related to its risk assessment protocols. Although NYCB's struggles prompted Fitch and Moody's to downgrade its credit rating, the bank highlighted that deposits remained stable in the recent quarter. NYCB shares added 17.4% on Tuesday, while shares of fellow regional lenders Citizen's Financial (CFG) and Zions (ZION) gained 5.2% and 4.5%, respectively.

Article title:  iPadOS 17.4のポッドキャストアプリでは英語など一部言語で「文字起こし」機能がサポート。

Article maintext:  iOS/iPadOS 17.4のポッドキャストアプリでは英語など一部言語で「文字起こし」機能がサポートされています。詳細は以下から。
Appleは現地時間2024年03月05日、iPhone XS以降のiPhoneやiPad (第6世代)以降のiPadなどに対し「iOS 17.4/iPadOS 17.4 Build 21E219」を正式にリリースしましたが、このiOS/iPadOS 17.4ではAppleのポッドキャストアプリで文字起こし機能が追加サポートされています。
文字起こし機能により、英語、スペイン語、フランス語、およびドイツ語でオーディオと同時にテキストがハイライト表示されエピソードを追うことが可能 リリースノートより
Appleによると、ポッドキャストアプリの文字起こし機能は、本日より最新のエピソードに文字起こししたテキストが追加され、過去のエピソードも今後順次文字起こし処理されるそうで、クリエイターはApple Podcasts Connectから文字起こし機能の設定を行うことが可能になっているそうです。
文字起こしされるのは現在のところ英語、スペイン語、フランス語、およびドイツ語でのみのサポートとなっていますが、文字起こしされたテキストには170以上の国と地域からアクセスでき、日本でも英語などのポッドキャスト番組を開くと右下または(…)の文字おこし表示メニューからエピソードの文字おこしを表示することが可能で、
文字おこし機能はテキスト検索や再生中の文章のハイライト、文字おこしされたテキストをタップすることでその場所からエピソードを再生できる機能も実装されており、聴覚に障害のあるユーザーはアクセシビリティを設定しておくことで文字おこしボタンを押すこと無く文字おこしされたテキストが表示されるようになっているそうなので、アップデートされた方はチェックしてみてください。

Article title:  Apple stock falls to lowest level this year, while other tech companies see AI-fuelled rally

Apple’s stock price has been taking a beating in the last few weeks, hitting a low for the year today, closing at $170.12.
Investors are pessimistic on the company’s outlook for a variety of reasons. Following a year of negative revenue growth in 2023, Apple executives forecast only meek growth guidance at its February earnings call. In the key Chinese market, there were more indications today that a recent streak of hot iPhone sales has come to an end. And investors are reeling from the EU’s $2bn fine for ‘illegal’ App Store policies, which threatens future Services revenue growth.
During its February earnings call, Apple’s China sales missed analyst estimated by more than $3 billion. The China news from today suggests iPhone sales are down 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, compared to a year ago. The report has scared investors into believing there will be sustained iPhone sales weakness throughout this year, with local smartphone manufacturers like Huawei becoming increasingly popular in the culture once again.
On Monday, Apple stock plummeted almost 3% following the news of the EU fine. The EU declared Apple’s anti-steering policies as illegal. Investors fear that more App Store policy changes are coming driven by regulation from pressure around the world, and that will cut into Apple’s Services growth trajectory with lower commissions from In-App Purchase.
Overall, AAPL stock is down 8.3% so far this year, and almost 13% off all time highs set at the end of last year.
While is true that many other tech stocks sold off in today’s session amidst a wider market pullback, the general trend for most big tech stocks has been positive with an artificial-intelligence hype train fuelled rally. For instance, Microsoft stock is up 8.5% this year. And the stock of AI chip manufacturer Nvidia has soared 78% in 2024 alone, with its market cap valuation approaching Apple in size.
In contrast, Apple is seen to be somewhat behind the times on AI, having not announced any major generative AI features so far. However, rumors indicate that is set to change at WWDC this June, with iOS 18 featuring deep AI integration across the system.
In a rare move, Apple CEO Tim Cook teased that Apple had major AI announcements in the pipeline during its last quarterly earnings call; these comments were doubled down on at its annual shareholders meeting held last week. The company is clearly conscious of the narrative that it is behind, and is keen to break it.

Article title:  负面消息缠身、未吃上 AI 红利，苹果公司股价创下今年新低

Article maintext:  IT之家 3 月 6 日消息，AI 浪潮推动英伟达、AMD、超微电脑等公司市值高歌猛进的大背景下，苹果却因为各种负面信息，股价创下 2024 年新低，目前每股 170.12 美元，公司市值为 2.63 万亿美元（当前约 18.94 万亿元人民币）。
总体而言，AAPL 股价今年迄今下跌了 8.3%，与去年年底创下的历史高点相比下跌了近 13%。
但大多数大型科技股的总体趋势是积极的，人工智能的炒作推动了股价的上涨。例如，微软股价今年上涨了 8.5%。而人工智能芯片制造商英伟达（Nvidia）的股价仅在 2024 年就飙升了 78%，其市值估值已接近苹果公司的规模。
IT之家简要梳理下苹果 2024 年的主要负面信息：
取消汽车项目
根据彭博社报道，苹果公司已搁置并取消了自动驾驶电动汽车的所有开发计划。苹果汽车项目启动已有十多年时间，期间投入了超过 100 亿美元（IT之家备注：当前约 721 亿元人民币），但最终决定这不是一个可行的项目。
MicroLED 版 Apple Watch Ultra 难产
苹果供应商之一的欧司朗 (OSRAM) 宣布一个“基石项目”意外取消。市场研究机构 Counterpoint Research 的显示供应链顾问告知 MacRumors，该项目正是传闻中用于 Apple Watch 的 microLED 显示屏。
欧洲新规以及 18.4 亿欧元罚款
苹果公司为了遵守《数字市场法案》，计划 3 月针对 27 个成员国开放第三方应用商城，以及调整 App Store、Safari 等，影响整个应用生态。
欧盟对苹果公司处以 18.4 亿欧元（IT之家备注：当前约 143.7 亿元人民币）的罚款，原因是其在 iOS 移动平台的音乐流媒体服务市场违反了反垄断规定。
在国内市场销售疲软
市场调研机构 Counterpoint Research 消息，今年前六周，苹果公司的 iPhone 系列手机在中国销量同比下降了 24%，在中国智能手机厂商中整体排名第四。

Article title:  未吃上AI红利，苹果公司股价创下今年新低

Article maintext:  IT之家 3 月 6 日消息，AI 浪潮推动英伟达、AMD、超微电脑等公司市值高歌猛进的大背景下，苹果却因为各种负面信息，股价创下 2024 年新低，目前每股 170.12 美元，公司市值为 2.63 万亿美元（当前约 18.94 万亿元人民币）。
总体而言，AAPL 股价今年迄今下跌了 8.3%，与去年年底创下的历史高点相比下跌了近 13%。
但大多数大型科技股的总体趋势是积极的，人工智能的炒作推动了股价的上涨。例如，微软股价今年上涨了 8.5%。而人工智能芯片制造商英伟达（Nvidia）的股价仅在 2024 年就飙升了 78%，其市值估值已接近苹果公司的规模。
IT之家简要梳理下苹果 2024 年的主要负面信息：
取消汽车项目
根据彭博社报道，苹果公司已搁置并取消了自动驾驶电动汽车的所有开发计划。苹果汽车项目启动已有十多年时间，期间投入了超过 100 亿美元（IT之家备注：当前约 721 亿元人民币），但最终决定这不是一个可行的项目。
MicroLED 版 Apple Watch Ultra 难产
苹果供应商之一的欧司朗 (OSRAM) 宣布一个“基石项目”意外取消。市场研究机构 Counterpoint Research 的显示供应链顾问告知 MacRumors，该项目正是传闻中用于 Apple Watch 的 microLED 显示屏。
欧洲新规以及 18.4 亿欧元罚款
苹果公司为了遵守《数字市场法案》，计划 3 月针对 27 个成员国开放第三方应用商城，以及调整 App Store、Safari 等，影响整个应用生态。
欧盟对苹果公司处以 18.4 亿欧元（IT之家备注：当前约 143.7 亿元人民币）的罚款，原因是其在 iOS 移动平台的音乐流媒体服务市场违反了反垄断规定。
在国内市场销售疲软
市场调研机构 Counterpoint Research 消息，今年前六周，苹果公司的 iPhone 系列手机在中国销量同比下降了 24%，在中国智能手机厂商中整体排名第四。

Article title:  The Next Phase Of The Bull Market: 5 Stocks For 2024 & Beyond

Article maintext:  5 Stocks For 2024 & Beyond
As an investor, it seems that, in the 2020s, every year has been extreme, reshaping financial markets to their cores. The COVID-crash of 2020, the
mini-bubble of 2021, and Russia’s war and the energy crisis in 2022 led to the most volatile period since, at least, the Great Financial Crisis. There is no denying that 2023 was another year to remember for investors, but compared to 2022, those memories will likely be much more pleasant as market conditions normalized and stocks resumed their secular bull market.
The large-cap benchmarks all gained considerable ground despite a deep autumn pullback in stocks, and, for the first time since 2021, even small-caps have started to flex their muscles toward the end of the year. The tech sector was front and center throughout 2023 due to the Nasdaq's stellar rally, fueled by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, but “under-the-hood,” new trends emerged in the second half of the year, which could dominate 2024.
Another way to look at 2023 is to treat it as a year of economic transition from an inflationary regime, characterized by healthy growth, rising interest rates, and tightening financial conditions, to a normal monetary era dominated by easier monetary conditions, lower growth rates, and, eventually, a series of rate cuts from the Fed. This transition will likely profoundly impact every investor’s portfolio in 2024, and staying ahead of the curve could yield huge returns for the sawy.
Before peaking into the future, let’s look in detail at how the investment landscape evolved over the past year.
What Changed in 2023 And What It All Means
While 2022 was a year of extreme risks, unexpected crises, and surging inflation, 2023 was all about successful adaptation; the world learned to live with disrupted energy and grain markets in the wake of Russia's invasion.
The tech sector overcame paralyzing chip shortages and returned to solid growth. Supply chains fully normalized, driving a rebound in global trade, while companies and consumers adjusted to a much higher level of interest rates without triggering a recession. These adaptations had one crucial thing in common: they were all disinflationary. Although, even a few months ago, inflation was still running well above the Fed’s and other central banks’ targets, we enter 2024 with more central banks cutting interest rates than hiking.
That is not to say that the market has not already priced in 2023's drop in inflation. In fact, in line with the Gorilla’s predictions, the tech sector outperformed the rest of the market by a wide margin after suffering a significant hit in 2022. Still, there is likely plenty of gas left in the tank for the market-leading Nasdaq. That said, with the inflation scare and the Fed’s tightening cycle now clearly behind us, participation in the bull market is set to improve, and stocks that remained under pressure in 2023 could join the rally in earnest next year as we enter the next phase of the bull market.
The Next Phase Of The Bull Market: Time For Rotation?
From an investment perspective, the third quarter of the year brought another major milestone, as earnings growth returned to corporate America following over a year of declines. As profits just started growing again following the start of Russia’s war, it is fair to say that the bulk of the ongoing cyclical bull market is likely ahead of us, and while 2023's tech leaders might need a breather, there are plenty of companies, and entire industries that remain very attractive despite 2023's gains. Companies with high market shares, robust moats, low debt, and modest growth were the most successful in 2022 and 2023, as uncertainty and volatility reigned supreme, but 2024 could be slightly different.
Since the monetary storm of the past couple of years is now over, the Gorilla believes that valuation metrics will start to matter more and more as investors are once again likely to broaden their investment horizons. As rate pressures are set to ease, slightly riskier companies with strong growth prospects could be back in the spotlight, as valuing long-term profits is becoming much easier once again. With that in mind, even though safety remains an important factor, being hyper-selective toward industry leaders and margin aristocrats, a strategy that served investors well for two years, could possibly hurt your returns in the coming quarters.
So, valuation and long-term growth prospects could take center stage in 2024, and the good news is that there are a slew of companies out there that offer stellar growth, value, or even both at the same time. As an example, great companies in late-cycle sectors, such as industrials, energy, and materials, are still dirt cheap. While institutions have been quietly gobbling up their stocks, keeping them from dropping, most investors have been focusing on the more popular issues of 2023.
However, before we get into the nitty-gritty of individual stock picks, let’s see what the outlook for the market, as a whole, looks like for 2024.
What The Market Is Trying To Tell Us
While it is true that the major indices are trading well above their pre- pandemic levels near all-time highs thanks to 2023’s gains, many investors and even analysts think that we are in a bear market. From a technical perspective and using common sense, this is definitely not the case. So, what gives?
Folks, over the past couple of years investor sentiment turned outright apocalyptic more than once, most recently in October, and yet, the Volatility Index (VIX) just hit a three-year low, with the major indices each looking to close 2023 near their yearly and all-time highs. Looking at the market without context and fear, everything seems to be indicating new highs in 2024. But, what the Gorilla called “a historic disconnect between sentiment and price action” six months ago continues to be in place, which suggests that there are still plenty of “low-hanging fruit” to pick up.
Given this decade’s wild years, from the pandemic's crash and furious recovery rally to last year's deep pullback and the subsequent tech-led surge, it is natural that most investors expect more fireworks. The Gorilla has seen this story too many times before - when the majority of investors believe in something, you should expect the exact opposite. Retail investors expect more volatility? Betting on a “boring” bullish year is likely the way to go. And the “smart money” seems to agree - hedging against a market crash using options has not been this cheap since 2019.
What’s more, both fundamentals and technicals seem to be pointing in the same direction as sentiment. Fundamentally speaking, inflation and growth, which both tend to boost nominal stock prices, are set to decrease in 2024 in the U.S. and globally, but domestic earnings growth is forecast to pick up, which should keep the bull market rolling given the modest valuation levels in most sectors. What about the impact of Russia’s war, the crisis in the Middle East, and the sanctions against China? Well, the latest forecasts from the World Trade Organization (WTO) suggest that global trade growth will
re-accelerate in 2024, despite widespread fears of de-globalization and trade fragmentation, and trade volume is likely to hit fresh record highs again.
2024, The Year Of The Breakout?
As for technicals, volatility dropped considerably in 2023, and barring another geopolitical or other “black swan” event, that trend could remain intact for a long time. Additionally, the ongoing bull market proved that it could withstand massive shocks like multiple armed conflicts, a surge in inflation, a banking crisis, and a trade spat between the two main powers of the planet, so the Gorilla would continue to view all short-term selloffs as entry points.
Having said that, while maturing bull markets tend to lift more and more stocks, the major indices also tend to settle down to a less-than-breakneck growth rate as capital flows toward the emerging new leaders of the rally. So, while it’s true that, defying all the negative catalysts, stocks are near their all-time highs, those highs will likely serve as strong technical resistance, making a grinding year for the large-cap benchmarks, rather than a stellar breakout more plausible.
Does that mean that no great returns are awaiting you next year? Heck no! However, investors should tweak their strategy to align with the market’s transition to maximize their returns, and the Gorilla is ready to share his strategy and his top picks to boost your returns in the next phase of the bull market.
The Optimal Strategy And The Gorilla’s Top Picks For 2024
Before jumping into the Gorilla’s picks for next year, let's summarize what investors should expect in 2024:
· The secular bull market in stocks is set to continue, despite the surge in geopolitical risks, as the underlying megatrends, such as the tech revolution, global trade expansion, and the emergence of the middle class in China and India remain intact
· Modest economic growth in the U.S, with a continued drop in inflation cautious, a less active Fed, and, in turn, lower volatility in stocks
· The U.S. economy is likely to outperform its developed peers thanks to its unparalleled domestic market, its energy security, and its exposure to the AI boom and other global megatrends
· The major indices are likely to hit new all-time highs, with more and more stocks joining the next phase of the bull market, but a grinding rally is more likely than an explosive breakout
· High-quality companies with slightly lower margins and modest debt loads could enjoy strong tailwinds as the monetary background turns more favorable
· Smaller issues focused on growth could outperform mega-cap stocks thanks to a rotation process following 2023’s “safety-first” rally
With all the above in mind, it is no surprise that finding winners for 2024 is trickier than last year, despite the intact megatrends and improving monetary backdrop. The “no-brainer” stocks of yesteryear might continue to provide decent returns. Still, in order to beat the market, a more thorough stock-picking process is necessary, and investors should prepare for a choppier and more frustrating year, at least when it comes to mega-cap stocks and the major indices.
Such a market shift, combined with the dreaded “Fear Of Missing Out” (FOMO) could even lead to painful mistakes, such as jumping in
already crowded trades, so being objective and taking a step back before pulling the trigger on new positions is a must, even in the highest quality names. Having said this, the ongoing market transition does not invalidate the Gorilla’s prior picks. In fact, one of his recent recommendations makes another appearance this time around.
The Gorilla’s Top Five Stocks for 2024!
The quickly changing market environment has opened the door for a new batch of stocks that are set to outperform the market next year and beyond, so you do not want to miss the Gorilla’s Top Five Stocks for 2024!
Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT): Solid Growth Play On A Secular Trend
Founded in 1925 by the legendary Conrad Hilton, the company carrying his legacy is one of the most famous brands in hospitality. The near-century-old company, with well over a million rooms under its belt and over 450K in its pipeline, Hilton is not just a strong brand; it is also among the industry's largest players. The company is active and growing in most market segments, from luxury hotels through its main focus, the upper-mid segment, to even budget offerings. Hilton's loyalty program, dubbed Hilton Honors, is also among the largest globally, with well north of 170 million members, so it's no surprise that the company has a sky-high customer
retention rate and a massive share of valuable recurring business contracts.
Successful Franchise Model With Improving Margins
Even though Hilton has been a household name in the hotel industry for, well, forever, the company went through a huge transformation over the past decade, shifting its business model to a predominantly franchise- based one, not unlike the Gorilla's prior report pick, Marriott (MAR).
While the two companies focus mainly on different market segments, with Hilton shooting lower on the price scale, the two companies share a similar strategy. Hilton now has an even greater share of franchise contracts than of less reliable incentive-based contracts.
Another critical change in Hilton's strategy has been its recent focus on international growth, with Europe and Asia being among its primary targets. As we saw earlier, the U.S. has traditionally been Hilton's primary market. However, when it comes to growth, the company's international segment has been the frontrunner in recent years, excluding the pandemic's impact. The company primarily based its expansion on in- house brands, including Canopy, Curio, and Spark, rather than following the industry-wide acquisition trend, which reduced cost and integration risks while leading to a more stable and organic growth trajectory.
Financials and Valuation
Financially speaking, Hilton's strategic shift, which is all but complete, led to a more reliable cash-flow structure with a much lower exposure to economic cycles, which is still only partially reflected in its share price.
That said, Hilton's valuation metrics got richer this year as its stock rode the bullish wave in hospitality, but the Gorilla thinks that HLT has plenty of room to run, and its recent strong performance suggests that the stock is ready to lead in 2024. On another positive note, while higher-end hotels recovered quicker from the COVID crisis, demand has been picking up across the board this year, with the more affordable segments catching up. That dynamic could support Hilton in the New Year and beyond.
In terms of growth, Hilton has been outperforming its closest peers by a wide margin since the pandemic, and according to its CEO, the company has the most units under construction in the industry. Looking at Hilton's expansion plans, it's clear that its growth will not slow down anytime soon, with nearly half a million rooms planned to come online over the coming years. Additionally, its shift toward new markets could mean its pipeline will expand in 2024. The company's revenue reached its pre- pandemic levels in 2022, and it kept on growing at a solid pace in 2023, surpassing $4 billion for the first time in Hilton's history.
The company's margins, profit, and free cash flow (FCF) metrics have been steadily improving for years, and it is set to hit $2 billion in FCF in 2024. Aside from financing growth, which third parties mostly drive due to Hilton's franchise model, Hilton has been increasingly returning capital to investors through dividends and stock buybacks, which accounted for over $2 billion in 2023. Even though the company's long-term debt remains above its pre-pandemic levels, Hilton's revenue and income growth means that its debt metrics have improved substantially over the past couple of years. Since interest rates are set to drop in 2024, Hilton's stable balance sheet could serve as a positive catalyst for its shares.
Technicals and Recent Performance
Hilton had a solid 2023 until November, in line with the continued fundamental improvements. Since then, it even started outperforming its closest peers and the large-cap benchmarks from a technical perspective. The stock broke out to a new all-time high in December for the first time since early 2022, possibly opening the door for a sustained bull run similar to HLT's 2017 pattern. While, from a short-term standpoint, the stock became overbought toward the end of the year, together with the large- cap benchmarks, its technical strength suggests that HLT could extend its technical breakout in 2024, resuming its secular bull market in earnest following two deep the two deep pullbacks of 2020 and 2022.
Amazon (AMZN): The Most Attractive Tech Giant
Amazon, without a doubt, is best known as an online retailer, the biggest one at that, but Jeff Bezos’s crown jewel is much more than that, with a quickly expanding portfolio of cloud offerings, subscriptions, and advertising services. Amazon is in the epicenter of multiple megatrends, the global tech transformation, the e-commerce boom, and the rise of the global middle class, which all contribute to its unique long-term growth prospects. The company has also jumped on the artificial intelligence (AI) bandwagon this year, as its cloud division unveiled its multi-layered - infrastructure-, platform-, and application-based - generative AI strategy. Even though the space is already getting crowded, Amazon’s reach and platform advantage could make it a major player in this exploding market.
Amazon is still, relatively speaking, a low-margin company compared to the tech sector's other giants, which could, at least partially, explain its underperformance since the start of the Fed’s tightening cycle. The COVID era’s e-commerce boom-bust cycle left its mark on investors’ sentiment toward Amazon and its peers, and that, together with the company's operational success and ongoing diversification push, makes it the easiest recommendation among the tech sector's behemoths for 2024. This is true even though wage pressures and cyclical risks remain apparent for the company that operates globally, employs over 1.5 million people, and rakes in north of $500 billion in annual revenue.
Cloud And Advertising Boom, Improving Margins, And Attractive Growth Prospects
Amazon’s quest over the past couple of years was to increase its margins after further establishing itself as the top online retailer globally during and after the COVID era. Setting aside cyclical fluctuations, the company's margins have been trending higher for a long time, but the Gorilla thinks the recent developments make Amazon a whole new beast, and investors could soon rethink how they value the company’s shares. Even though Amazon's evolution has even accelerated recently, with it adding new businesses seemingly every quarter, the company has already come a long way over the past decade.
Amazon's margins have been improving for multiple reasons, with the explosive growth of Amazon Web Services (AWS) being the most obvious, as the segment’s offerings leverage a slew of secular shifts, including automation, digitization, changing consumer habits, real-time data analytics, and more. That said, advertising services, essentially aiding third-party sellers, brands, and authors, became Amazon’s most dynamic revenue stream, growing by over 25% in the third quarter of 2023, and becoming a $10 billion per quarter business on its own. AI-driven optimization, competitive pricing, and efficiency have been the main drivers behind the segment’s growth, which dwarfed the expansion rate of Facebook parent Meta's (META) and Google parent Alphabet’s (GOOG), more established, similar businesses.
On the retail side, the company's third-party seller services flourished as Amazon went through a rather significant revamp of its fulfillment system while completing a series of significant cost-cutting rounds, including mass layoffs. The company's automation push has broadened and accelerated since the start of the pandemic, as has its reliance on big data, AI, and machine learning, and, according to the company’s management, this trend will continue unabated.
Using AMZN's pre-COVID margins in its main business as a baseline, Amazon achieved tangible improvements in its already hyper-efficient system, which could lead to a long-term boost to profitability and per- share return that is not yet "priced in'' by the market.
Financials and Valuation
The combination of the COVID boom and the subsequent slump in online sales makes it tricky to evaluate Amazon’s revenue, income, and profitability measures over the past few years. However, following a challenging 2022, it is hard to ignore the company's quicker-than- expected recovery. Company-wide revenue growth has been in the double-digits throughout 2023, with Amazon consistently blowing away analyst expectations in all quarters on both its top and bottom lines.
The AWS segment, which raked in ~$25 billion in income or around 65% of Amazon’s total income over the past twelve months, has seen its growth moderate as the cloud sector slowed down post-pandemic, but analysts expect cloud growth to pick up again.
The segment’s AI and generative AI offerings, an opportunity in the tens of billions according to the company's management, could trigger another bout of strong expansion for AWS, as Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), and a slew of analysts predict that Amazon will be among the AI boom’s primary beneficiaries in 2024. With all that in mind, while a company worth over $1.5 trillion rarely qualifies as a growth play, Amazon could be in for another decade of above-average revenue expansion, which, coupled with its improving profitability, might send its earnings skyrocketing.
Technicals and Recent Performance
While, as discussed earlier, it is true that Amazon has lagged its fellow tech giants in the war era, the tide began shifting in the second half of 2023.
AMZN gained significant ground in 2023, adding over 70%, but it remains well shy of its all-time high, even though the company's earnings ratios are nearing record levels, suggesting that its recovery could even gain steam in 2024. AMZN is trading in a strong bullish trend, and after completing the first deeper pullback of the trend in November, the stock could be among the leaders in the New Year.
Rio Tinto PLC (RIO): High-Tech Mining Company At A Discount
Even though mining companies are not the sexiest investments out there, especially following the past couple of years’ volatility in commodity prices, Anglo-Australian giant Rio Tinto has some unique properties that make it an attractive option for 2024 and beyond. The company’s technological leadership in exploration, mining, and logistics gives it an edge compared to its closest rivals and its smaller competitors, while its strong financial position could support strategic asset purchases in the coming years. Following a decade characterized by a strategic shift, Rio is ready to grow again, not just making its current price a bargain but potentially setting the stage for a strong rally in its stock as interest rates retreat.
Rio Tinto is already the world's second-largest mining company, with operations spanning 35 countries and a slew of minerals, which exposes the company to powerful global megatrends that, together with its long-term partnerships, mitigate the inherently cyclical nature of its business.
Global infrastructure spending is expected to outpace economic growth in the coming decade, and Rio is in a prime position to profit from that trend thanks to its strong presence in the Asia-Pacific, South America, and Europe.
Improving Cost Profile, Resilience, And A Future-Proof Portfolio
As for its mining portfolio, iron ore is responsible for over half of Rio’s revenues, with aluminum accounting for a bit less than a quarter, and the rest equally divided between its copper and minerals segments. Rio is set to produce more than 330 million tons (MT) of iron ore, 3.2 MT of aluminum, and 0.6 MT and 1.2 MT of copper and other minerals, respectively, in 2023, with 80% of its profits coming from its mature iron ore segment. That said, its ongoing strategic projects aim to diversify its income streams further while maintaining its strong position in the iron ore market, with a strong focus on copper, aluminum, lithium, and other minerals essential for the quickly expanding renewable energy sector.
The last couple of years have been challenging, to say the least, for Rio, as a sharp drop in metal prices and a global surge in inflation put pressure on its margins, but the way the company dealt with its issues speaks volumes of its resilience. Rio’s relentless cost-cutting push has yielded excellent results in recent years, with automation, divestment of its high-cost assets, and a leaner management approach driving savings since 2013. The company, founded in 1875, had its fair share of environmental controversies during its long history, but it has made a lot of progress toward sustainability and safe production over the past decade, reducing its operational and litigation risks. Also, in line with its strategic transition and the changing regulatory environment, Rio finished divesting its coal assets in 2018, future-proofing its portfolio.
Financials and Valuation
Rio Tinto remained profitable throughout the past couple of years’ troubles, generating solid operating cash-flows despite price and wage pressures, along with the global supply chain crisis. Rio's net income is approaching $9 billion in 2023, well above the levels seen during prior global slowdowns. Moreover, its solid margins and broadening portfolio mean that the coming years provide plenty of potential upside in sales and profits alike, and even in the case of further commodity price weakness, the company's shares could enjoy tailwinds. Heavily investing in future output has been Rio’s strategy for years, with its capital expenditures (CAPEX) increasing the most among its peers since the 2016 commodity market bottom. Its ongoing Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia alone is set to produce up to 500K tons of copper upon completion amid a predicted surge in demand for the commodity, with its aluminum and lithium businesses also promising solid growth until 2030 and beyond.
Besides continuing its long history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends, Rio is also planning to increase its CAPEX spending to
$10 billion in 2024 and 2025, up from roughly $8 billion in 2023. The company’s substantial cash hoard of over $10 billion and strong operating cash flows mean its financing costs could remain low even in the current high-rate environment. Rio halved its debt load over the past decade, contributing to its resilience in the face of rising interest rates.
Rio’s strong balance sheet also helped the company maintain a stable debt investment grade rating and outlook, a huge competitive advantage in the sector.
Technicals and Recent Performance
While, compared to this 2023's leading sectors and stocks, RIO has been among the laggards, finishing the year flat, it closed the year on a promising note. The stock has been trading in a long-term base pattern for most of 2023, but it managed to break out of its broad trading range before the end of the year, which could indicate the start of a sustained rally. 2023’s trading range also serves as a strong technical support zone, with the $60 price level as a “hard floor.” Should commodity prices continue their recovery in 2024, RIO could easily target its all-time high, given the company’s operational success and ambitious growth plans.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): Destined For Explosive Growth
For those who read the Gorilla’s summer report, AMD, one of the world's leading chipmakers, is likely a familiar name, as Intel’s (INTC) fierce rival in the PC and server markets appeared on his top picks list. Even though demand for AMD's products saw a sharp cyclical drop in 2022, following a COVID-fueled boom, the semiconductor sector was buzzing throughout 2023 due to the generative AI boom. This year's dynamics brought back memories of the pandemic era’s chip shortages, as demand for chips needed to train and run AI models skyrocketed, and this trend is unlikely to slow down in 2024.
While Nvidia (NVDA) is the dominant force in the AI hardware space, AMD has been developing its own targeted solutions for years, and with the company's strategic partnerships in mind, it is in a prime position to quickly gain market share in the expanding segment. Since June, when the Gorilla last recommended AMD, the company’s outlook has become brighter, even considering the stock’s almost 20% gain.
In light of its most recent announcements, AMD could be among the leaders in 2024, and its prospects make the stock worthy of the Gorilla’s reiterated recommendation.
History Of Great Execution Hints At A Blowout Year
With AI exploding into the mainstream, demand for the company's data center solutions is likely to grow exponentially, and, given the limited global manufacturing capacities, prices are expected to rise, which could have a knock-on effect on the company’s consumer products as well. AMD’s focus on data centers is even more understandable, considering the company’s bold prediction that the AI data center market alone will surpass a mind- boggling $400 billion. The company's server business, which has been a price-performance leader for years, is another strong source of revenue, boasting partnerships with companies such as Dell (DELL) and Lenovo, and it could provide massive technological synergies with AMD's AI-targeted products.
As for the competitive landscape, according to CEO Lisa Su, the company's newly announced MI300 chip family caught up with Nvidia's offerings in AI training tasks thanks to a roughly 60% performance boost while even surpassing their main competitor, H100 chips, in some tasks. Her claims were backed up by Microsoft's (MSFT), Oracle's (ORCL), and Meta’s (META) announcements that they plan to use AMD's solutions in their data centers, which greatly contributed to the market’s positive reaction, and for a good reason. AMD’s recent track record in execution and breakneck-paced innovation makes it a great candidate to take a huge slice of the AI pie in the coming years, despite competition from the likes of Intel and Arm (ARM) and the in-house hardware projects of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon, and a slew of other companies.
Folks, we are seeing the emergence of a new industry that, while it will have its ups and downs, will shake the tech world to its core while also having a huge impact on other sectors. AMD is one of the best ways to play this boom, which will lead to productivity gains and quality-of-life improvements while driving the acceleration of existing trends such as digitization, automation, product personalization, and on-the-fly process optimization.
Admittedly, the past year’s AI hype led to a lot of noise in the sector, but the hard data suggests that the demand is real and quickly growing and that we are just seeing the beginning of a transformative business cycle.
Financials and Valuation
While the company’s consumer segment remained under pressure this year, its revenue is back on a positive trajectory, with AMD expecting a nearly 10% increase in the last quarter of 2023, nearing $6 billion, which is up by over 300% compared to 2019, the last pre-COVID year. Growth has been driven by the company's data center and client segments, with the former segment expanding by over 20% quarterly and the client segment growing by nearly 50% year-over-year in the third quarter. AMD’s income growth has been industry-leading in the third quarter, albeit from a low basis, and while uncertainty surrounding next year's performance is still substantial, AMD itself and most analysts have revised their 2024 revenue and profit estimates higher multiple times over the past months.
AMD's balance sheet remains rock solid, with a long-term debt load of less than $2 billion and plenty of liquid assets north of $5 billion. The company’s strong financial position opens the door for further acquisitions, just like the successful integration of Xilinx and Pansenado, while also providing an excellent backdrop for continued organic growth in the coming years. While AMD is not currently paying a dividend, the company has been returning capital to its shareholders through stock buybacks since mid-2021, using its pandemic-era profits, which halted the past decade’s trend of dilution.
Technicals and Recent Performance
AMD had a great 2023, despite a deep mid-year pullback, as the stock regained its bullish momentum toward the end of the year, taking out its summer maximum and hitting a fresh over-two-year high. The stock is trading in a strong advancing trend, and after erasing its grueling multi- month pullback, it could be ready to test or even surpass its all-time high in 2022, despite its current overbought trade. That said, investors should consider that AMD is likely to experience the most volatility among the Gorilla’s picks, being exposed to quickly evolving markets, with geopolitics and the ongoing trade spat between the U.S. and China also posing risks for its business.
Phillips 66 (PSX): The Turnaround Story Of 2024?
Ever since its spin-off from ConocoPhillips (COP) in 2012, Phillips 66, a company with nearly 150 years of history, has been a major player in the refining business, and today, it is among the top three U.S. companies in the sector not involved in crude oil production. The Houston-based company is a diversified, semi-integrated energy manufacturer and logistics provider, with its primary business being the processing and marketing of fuels and chemicals. Phillips also provides oil and gas transportation, storage, and terminaling services, but the main driver of PSX's income is refining, which has been a segment making a lot of headlines over the past couple of years.
Energy demand has been strong in the wake of the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the U.S. quietly becoming the world's top energy exporter amid the restructuring of the global market. With that in mind, and given the fact that PSX just hit an all-time high, how on earth is the company a candidate for a turnaround, you might ask? Well, according to the PSX’s management and a slew of analysts, the company could be worth much more, and the stock’s underperformance compared to its closest peers confirms that. The recent involvement of Elliott Management, an activist hedge fund that helped PSX's competitor Marathon Petroleum (MPC) in its turnaround, could serve as a crucial catalyst for the company to complete its operational reform, and it could very well trigger a memorable rally in its shares in 2024.
Structural Refining Shortage Provides Huge Opportunity For A Turnaround
The fundamental story behind the recent surge in the shares of “downstream” energy companies primarily focusing on refining and distribution is a structural shortage in refining capacity following the disruptions caused by the pandemic. Stocks of PSX's main products dropped to historically low levels, causing prices and spreads compared to crude oil to spike and remain elevated. Most experts agree that these conditions will likely persist as investment in refining capacity remains low. However, looking at its stock’s performance, it seems that Phillips still has some work to do to fully benefit from the favorable trends.
Elliott’s founder, Paul Singer, did not reinvent the wheel with his proposals; in fact, the company had already laid out a similar operational reform plan to the hedge fund’s roadmap - grabbing the Gorilla’s attention - well before the activist investors entered the picture, but Elliott’s involvement makes a successful turnaround much more likely.
The company’s original plans included:
· Sizable cost-cutting measures.
· Divesting over $3 billion of its non-core assets.
· Increasing its shareholder distributions through dividends and stock buybacks.
Compared to its prior unsuccessful reform pushes, Phillips has already made strides in 2023 toward its goals, and those results, which include an uptick in margins, a drop in operating costs, and improving capacity utilization, together with the recently announced additional measures, are very promising.
Why could 2024 be the year when Phillips finally starts to outperform? Well, besides the outside influences, the already enacted reforms, and the continued shortages, the end of the Fed’s tightening cycle also came at an excellent time for Phillips, giving the company more breathing room to execute its plans, promising lower financing costs and a possible pickup in growth in the second half of the New Year.
Financials and Valuation
While Phillips’s post-COVID recovery was a rocky affair in terms of the company’s cost structure, its 2021 revenue had already reached pre- pandemic levels near $111 billion and surged to $170 billion in 2022 as energy prices roared higher. The fact that the company’s income remained stable despite a drop in crude prices and revenue in 2023, shows how tight the refining market has become. While stocks of refined products improved somewhat in 2023, they are still well below their historic averages, and the crude oil-gasoline spreads driving refinery profits could remain elevated for years. The PSX’s profits are on track to hit $7.5 billion in 2023, so while its long-term debt load stands at a relatively high $18.5 billion, its balance sheet is still quite healthy from a financing standpoint.
When compared to its closest peers, Phillips looks undervalued, especially given its declining share count and its impressive FCF potential, which is projected to reach $9 billion in 2025. However, PSX’s high-cost levels explain some of its stock’s discount. The company significantly raised its distributions to shareholders over the past year, and it is planning to return over 10% of the company’s market cap in 2024 alone, which could be a major bullish per-share catalyst for the New Year. While the planned phase- out of gasoline-powered vehicles is a long-term risk for Phillips and the entire industry, the most pessimistic estimates still point to over a decade of very lucrative market conditions due to the structural refining capacity shortages. What’s more, the Gorilla thinks that its low valuation metrics already reflect the eventual decline in gasoline demand and that owning Phillips’s stock could provide significant total returns to investors for years to come.
Technicals and Recent Performance
Even though PSX had a solid 2023, gaining over 25% and scoring an all-time high in November, the stock underperformed its closest rivals amid the strong fundamental tailwinds. PSX broke out above the strong resistance level near $125 after a multi-month consolidation period, which marked its 2018 high, and the current technical setup could easily morph into a “runaway” breakout pattern. On a cautionary note, the stock still needs to prove that its recent relative strength compared to its peers is not temporary, but the prospect of a successful operational turnaround could just be the catalyst needed for a blowout year for PSX.
Conclusion
Bull markets, based on secular megatrends, are capable of creating immense wealth, and there is no doubt that we are in the middle of a bull market despite sky-high geopolitical tensions, inflation, and the highest interest rates in decades. In fact, stocks are on track to fully leave behind 2022’s pullback, even though the global economy is slowing and Russia's war in Ukraine still has no end in sight. The U.S. economy and corporate sector proved their resilience again, which will likely carry stocks higher for years to come as we leave the chaotic beginning of the 2020s behind.
However, stocks are undoubtedly stretched going into 2024 due to a very strong year-end rally, which could lead to an orderly profit-taking event sometime in the first quarter of the New Year. Pullbacks are inevitable in free markets and beneficial for patient investors, resetting sentiment and providing great buying opportunities. With that in mind, there is no harm in waiting for a pullback if you are uncomfortable with temporary drawdowns.
Having said that, you should not forget that the Gorilla’s picks, which are all strong businesses with great growth prospects, are poised to rise in 2024, no matter the pullbacks, and bull markets are known to be hard to enter when they really get going. It means that buying these stocks immediately and forgetting about them is also a valid strategy for a patient investor; their long-term success is all but guaranteed. As legendary investor Warren Buffet once said, “The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.”
At the end of the day, the choice is yours, but with the help of the Gorilla’s experience spanning multiple market cycles, the odds will be in your favor no matter what route you choose. Determining the right stocks to own in 2024 and beyond should give you the confidence to take a step back, shut out the day-to-day noise, and enjoy the ride as the secular bull market enters its next phase and stocks resume their journey to new record highs!

Article title:  Пока Nvidia взлетает всё выше, акции Apple упали до рекордного минимума в этом году

Article maintext:  В последние несколько недель цена акций Apple падала, достигнув вчера, 5 марта, минимума за год, закрывшись на отметке $170,12.
Инвесторы пессимистично оценивают перспективы компании по ряду причин. На ключевом китайском рынке продажи iPhone обваливаются. Инвесторы обеспокоены штрафом ЕС в размере 2 миллиардов долларов за «незаконную» политику App Store, что ставит под угрозу будущий рост доходов от сервисов. В понедельник акции Apple упали почти на 3% после новостей о штрафе ЕС за незаконную политику Apple, обеспечивающую доминирование на рынке за счет магазина приложений App Store и стримингового музыкального сервиса.
В целом акции AAPL в этом году упали на 8,3%, что почти на 13% ниже исторического максимума, установленного в конце прошлого года.
Хотя многие другие акции технологических компаний распродавались на фоне широкого отката рынка, общая тенденция для большинства крупных технологических акций была положительной, поскольку ажиотаж вокруг искусственного интеллекта подпитывал ралли. Например, акции Microsoft в этом году выросли на 8,5%. А акции производителя чипов искусственного интеллекта Nvidia выросли на 78% только в 2024 году, что позволило ей попасть в топ-3 самых дорогих компаний
Во время последнего квартального отчёта генеральный директор Apple Тим Кук (Tim Cook) заявил, что у Apple есть важные анонсы в области искусственного интеллекта, которые ожидаются на июньской конференции.

Article title:  iOS 17.4ではiPhone 15/Proシリーズの「バッテリーの状態」にバッテリーの充放電回数や製造日、使用開始日などが追加。

Article maintext:  iOS 17.4ではiPhone 15シリーズで「バッテリーの状態」にバッテリーの充放電回数や製造日、使用開始日などが追加されています。詳細は以下から。
Appleは現地時間2024年03月05日、iPhone XS以降のiPhone向けに新しい絵文字やポッドキャストアプリの文字起こし機能などを実装した「iOS 17.4 Build 21E219」をリリースしましたが、このiOS 17.4ではiPhone 15とiPhone 15 Proシリーズで、iPhoneのバッテリー状態を確認しやすくなっています。
iPhone 15とiPhone 15 Proの機種で、“設定”の“バッテリーの状態”にバッテリーの充放電回数、製造日、および最初の使用を表示 リリースノートより抜粋
iPhone 15/Proシリーズでは、iOS 13で導入された機械学習を利用してユーザーの行動を把握しiPhoneを利用する直前までバッテリーの充電率を80%で止めることでバッテリーの劣化を防ぐ電源管理機能「最適化されたバッテリー充電」が拡張され、バッテリーの充電率の上限を約80%までに制限する「充電の最適化」機能が設定アプリの[バッテリー] → [バッテリーの充電と最適化]ページから設定できましたが、
iOS 17.4へアップデートされたiPhone 15/Proシリーズでは、[バッテリーの充電と最適化]が[バッテリーの状態]と[充電の最適化]に分けられています。
[充電の最適化]と[バッテリーの状態]
まず、追加された[充電の最適化]では、引き続き機械学習を利用してユーザーがiPhone 15/Proシリーズを使用していない充電中はバッテリー充電率を80%で止め、使い始める直前に100%まで充電する「バッテリー充電の最適化」と、バッテリー充電率の上限を80%にする「上限80%」、常に100%まで充電する「なし」の設定が可能で、
次に[バッテリーの状態]では、iOS 17.3以前のiPhone 15/Proシリーズで、設定アプリの[設定] → [一般] → [情報]の一番下に記載されていたバッテリーの製造日や最初の使用時期、充放電回数が集約され、バッテリーのパフォーマンスや交換推奨情報と合わせて見やすく表示できるようになっています。
また、AppleはiPhone 15/Proシリーズ発売から十分なフィールドテストを実施した結果、iPhone 15/Proシリーズでは、バッテリーが最初の蓄電容量の80%を維持できる充電サイクルをこれまでの500回から倍の1,000回に変更しているので、バッテリーに関して言えばiPhone 15/Proシリーズは以前のiPhoneより長く使えそうです。
iPhone 14 モデル以前のバッテリーは、理想的な条件下で使用された場合、フル充電サイクルを 500 回繰り返した後も本来の蓄電容量の 80% を維持するよう設計されています*。iPhone 15 モデルのバッテリーは、理想的な条件下で使用された場合、フル充電サイクルを 1,000 回繰り返した後も本来の蓄電容量の 80% を維持するよう設計されています*。 iPhoneのバッテリーとパフォーマンス – Apple サポート

Article title:  Apple stock most oversold since 2018; eyes on the $165 level

Article maintext:  Published Mar 06, 2024 04:11AM ET
© Reuters Apple (AAPL) stock most oversold since 2018; watch for Oct. 2023 lows, analyst says
AAPL -0.07% Add to/Remove from Watchlist
In a Tuesday note, BTIG analysts noted a rotational trend in the equity market, where investors are taking profits from the best-performing stocks, leading to a mixed performance across different sectors.
Analysts said high momentum stocks experienced a significant drop on Tuesday, marking their worst day since November 2022, though this is viewed as part of a normal market fluctuation.
The GS High Beta Momentum Long index is still up 23% year-to-date, while its 50-day moving average (DMA) is roughly 12% below current levels, marking “a decent downside target,” analysts said.
“While long-momentum broadly is underperforming today, perhaps the biggest molong Nvidia (NVDA, Not Rated) is barely down. If this is the start of a bigger correction broadly, it likely won't be complete until NVDA sees some sort of shakeout,” they wrote.
Analysts also highlighted Apple’s (AAPL) performance, which is currently in an oversold condition with its daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 23, the lowest since December 2018.
Despite being oversold, the stock has broken through a volume shelf around $173, and if it cannot reclaim this level, the lows of October 2023 around $165 could become a target, they noted.
Sector-wise, energy and regional banks are performing well, and small-cap value stocks are showing signs of breaking out.

Article title:  Down 40%, Will New Models And Budget EV Help Nio Stock Rebound?

Article maintext:  BEIJING, CHINA - JUNE 25: Customers look at a NIO ET7 executive electric sedan at a NIO Inc. ... [+] showroom on June 25, 2022 in Beijing, China. (Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images) VCG via Getty Images
Chinese luxury electric vehicle maker Nio stock posted mixed delivery numbers for February, delivering 8,132 cars for the month, down 19% from January and 33% lower from the year-ago period. The decline was not really surprising, given that automotive sales in China are usually weak in January and February, due to the extended Chinese New Year holiday, which impacts manufacturing and sales. The holiday fell between February 10 and 17 this year, versus last year when it fell between January 21 and 27. Moreover, Nio’s customers are also likely to have waited a bit for 2024 model year updates which are due in March and this is also likely to have impacted its delivery numbers. In comparison, Nio’s rival Xpeng sold 4,545 EVs for the month, down 44.9% from January, and down 24% from the year-ago period, while Li Auto sold 20,251 cars, down 35% from January, although it marks an increase of about 22% compared to last year.
Amid the current backdrop, NIO stock has underperformed the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were -35% in 2021, -69% in 2022, and -7% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that NIO underperformed the S&P in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Consumer Discretionary sector including AMZN, TSLA, and TM, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could NIO face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?
There are concerns about global EV demand, with most mainstream automakers seeing tepid demand and scaling back on their electrification goals. For instance, Mercedes-Benz dialed back on its target of going all-electric by 2030, now estimating that only 50% of total sales would be EVs. We’ve seen similar production scalebacks from the likes of Ford as well. While the Chinese EV market is poised to post double-digit growth this year, competition and price wars are mounting. Investors have been concerned about Nio’s price cuts, which impacted average selling prices and reduced gross margins in recent quarters. For example, Nio posted a gross margin of 8% in Q3 2023, down from 13.3% in the year-ago period, compared to Li Auto which posted gross margins of 22%, up from 12.7% in Q3 of 2022. The company has yet to report Q4 results. That being said, there are some positives for Nio as well. The company has been steadily expanding its model base. The company now has a total of five SUVs and three sedans in its model line. Nio is also making progress with its battery technology and battery-swapping partnerships. Nio is also looking to enter the lower end of the market via new sub-brands, expanding beyond its premium price range. For example, the company plans to launch EVs at a price tag of about $28,000 sometime in early 2024, under a brand called Alps. The stock also presently trades at just 1x estimated 2023 revenues, which is well below other EV players such as Tesla TSLA and Li Auto.

Article title:  Up 69% In The Last 12 Months, Here’s What To Expect From Salesforce Stock

Article maintext:  Sign with logo at the regional office of Salesforce in the Silicon Valley, Palo Alto, California, ... [+] November 2, 2018. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Getty Images
Salesforce stock (NYSE: CRM) has gained 20% YTD, as compared to the 8% rise in the S&P500 over the same period. Further, at its current price of $315 per share, it is trading 3% below its fair value of $323 – Trefis’ estimate for Salesforce’s valuation.
Amid the current financial backdrop, CRM stock has shown strong gains of 40% from levels of $225 in early January 2021 to around $315 now, vs. an increase of about 35% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the increase in CRM stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 14% in 2021, -48% in 2022, and 98% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that CRM underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including MSFT, AAPL, and NVDA, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and AMZN. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could CRM face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperformed the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?
The company outperformed the street estimates in Q4 FY 2024 (FY Feb-Jan), the fourth earnings beat in a row. It posted total revenues of $9.29 billion – up 11% y-o-y, primarily driven by a 12% increase in subscription and support revenues, somewhat offset by a 9% drop in the professional services segment. Notably, the subscription and support segment, which derives close to 95% of the top line, mainly benefited from growth in sales cloud, service cloud, and integration & analytics sub-categories. On the cost front, the operating margin improved from 4.3% to 17.5% due to a 7% decrease in operating expenses. Further, the loss on strategic investment was reduced from $314 million to $35 million. Overall, the net income improved from -$98 million to $1.45 billion.
The company’s top line grew 11% y-o-y to $34.9 billion in FY 2024. It was primarily because of a 12% rise in the subscription & support revenues. In addition, both the cost of revenues and operating expenses as a % of revenues witnessed a favorable drop. It resulted in an operating margin of 14.4% vs 3.3%. It resulted in a net income of $4.14 billion, as compared to the figure of $208 million in the year-ago period.
CRM announced a restructuring plan at the start of 2023 intended to drive operational efficiency. The company has substantially completed the plan by Q4 and is committed to continuing its efforts over the subsequent quarters. We expect this move to benefit the bottom line. Further, continued business spending on digital transformation projects and Salesforce’s CRM leadership position in the customer-relationship management software space is a big plus for its revenue growth. We estimate Salesforce’s revenues to be around $38 billion in FY2025. Additionally, CRM’s revenue per share is likely to increase to $37.62. This coupled with a P/S of multiple of 8.6x will lead to a valuation of $323.

Article title:  鬥爭升級！蘋果終止Epic Games開發者帳號

Article maintext:  《要塞英雄》(Fortnite)遊戲開發商 Epic Games 周三 (6 日) 表示蘋果 (AAPL-US) 已終止其開發者帳戶，這是兩家公司因蘋果應用程式商店收取費用結下樑子以來最新鬥爭升級。
Epic Games 打算利用該開發者帳戶將其線上市集、Epic Games Store 和《要塞英雄》遊戲引入歐洲的 iOS 設備，不過沒想到卻遭蘋果終止其帳戶。就在幾周前，Epic Games 還在 X(前推特) 上發文說「開發者帳戶安全了，我們走吧！」
Epic Games 怒斥蘋果大大違反《數位市場法》(Digital Markets Act, DMA)，也表明蘋果無意允許 iOS 設備上出現真正的競爭。該公司還說，蘋果有意透過此取消除其 App Store 最大的潛在競爭對手。
截稿前，蘋果和歐盟執委會並未立即回應置評請求。
蘋果在今年 1 月趕在最後期限 3 月 7 日之前提出了一些修改建議，以符合 DMA 的某些條件。DMA 旨在讓歐洲用戶更容易在相互競爭的服務之間切換。
蘋果當時表示會允許 iPhone 上有其他應用商店，並讓用戶選擇不使用應用程式內支付系統，但對註冊加入新制度的開發者，每個開發者帳號每年要收取 50 歐分的「核心技術費」 。
自 2020 年以來，蘋果與 Epic Games 兩家公司一直處於法律戰之中，當時後者聲稱，蘋果對 iPhone 和其他設備的應用內支付收取高達 30% 佣金的做法違反美國的反壟斷法規。

Article maintext:  Unsurprisingly, Apple NASDAQ: AAPL scrapped its plans to build an electric vehicle. After ten years of effort, the goal to launch a 100% autonomous vehicle in 2024 failed to produce even a timeline of when a car might come, and now it's 2024. Add in the fact the EV market bubble has burst, and there are other fruits to gather, and it makes sense for the shift. Ultimately,…

Article title:  Up 26% Already This Year, What Is Next For Tripadvisor Stock?

Article maintext:  Tripadvisor logo displayed on a phone screen and a map of Krakow are seen in this illustration photo ... [+] taken in Krakow, Poland on August 17, 2021. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images
After a 26% growth since the beginning of 2024, at the current price of around $27 per share, we believe Tripadvisor’s stock (NASDAQ NDAQ : TRIP), an online travel company providing booking for hotel reservations, transportation, lodging, and travel experiences, is fairly priced and could likely be pressured in the short to medium term. TRIP stock has increased from around $21 to $27 YTD, outperforming the broader indices, with the S&P growing 8% during the same period. Liberty Tripadvisor Holdings has stated its intention to engage in discussions regarding a potential acquisition, prompting the formation of a special committee to evaluate proposals resulting from these discussions. It should be noted that LTRPA owns 21.1% of Tripadvisors’ shares outstanding and TRIP’s stock price has gained traction since this announcement. That said, Tripadvisor stock has been struggling for years as its audiences have moved elsewhere and the demand for online advertising has been weak due to tough competition from Google GOOG . It is difficult to compare Tripadvisor’s current business with its previous business model because it has reorganized over the years. However, in 2019, the company’s Tripadvisor brand (representing 60% of its sales then) generated revenue of $939 million. By comparison, in 2023 the company’s Tripadvisor Core CORE brand (~58% of sales now) generated a total revenue of $1,031 million - signaling only a small revenue growth during this period. In addition, Tripadvisor’s gross margins have always been consistently more than 90%. But still, despite such high margins, the company’s profits have been scarce and far between through the years, largely due to higher spending on sales and marketing.
TRIP stock has seen a decline of 15% from levels of $30 in early January 2021 to around $27 now, vs. an increase of about 35% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. Notably, TRIP stock has underperformed the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were -5% in 2021, -34% in 2022, and 20% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that TRIP underperformed the S&P in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including MSFT, AAPL, and NVDA, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and AMZN. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could TRIP face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?
Tripadvisor’s sales shot higher in fiscal 2023 to an all-time high value of $1.8 billion, reflecting a 20% annual growth. Net income for the full year was $10 million, or $0.08 diluted EPS - down 42% year-over-year (y-o-y). The company spent aggressively on marketing and technology development, especially in the Viator and core Tripadvisor platforms. The company’s Q4 revenues rose 10% y-o-y to $390 million. Its adjusted Q4 EBITDA of $84 million, or 22% of revenue, came in better than expected due to a favorable channel mix and disciplined marketing spending. Viator allows third parties to list bookable experiences on its platform. It then collects the payment through travelers’ bookings, pays the experience organizer, and keeps a cut for itself in a much similar way to how Airbnb does business. Viator now contributes to 40% of total revenues and its revenues grew almost 50% y-o-y to $737 million in FY 2023.
We have revised Tripadvisor’s valuation to $26 per share, based on a $1.07 expected EPS and a 23.9x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2024 - almost 4% lower than the current market price. We forecast Tripadvisor’s Revenues to be nearly $2 billion for the fiscal year 2024, up 10% y-o-y.
It is helpful to see how its peers stack up. TRIP Peers shows how Tripadvisor’s stock compares against peers on metrics that matter. You will find other useful comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Article title:  Na disputa de quem investe melhor, republicanos perdem feio para democratas

Article maintext:  Por lei, os investimentos de congressistas americanos são divulgados publicamente – e uma gestora criou ETFs para espelhar o desempenho das aplicações
Publicidade
Donald Trump e Joe Biden saíram fortalecidos da “Super Terça”, e crescem as chances de a dupla disputar mais uma vez o comando da Casa Branca. As eleições ocorrem apenas em novembro deste ano, mas uma coisa os democratas já podem: na comparação de quem lida melhor com seus investimentos, o “time” do atual presidente americano é o claro vitorioso.
Os investimentos realizados pelos congressistas democratas acumulam rendimento de mais de 34% nos últimos 12 meses, o dobro do atingido pelas aplicações dos pares republicanos no mesmo período. As rentabilidades são rastreadas por dois ETFs (fundos de índice) da gestora Subversive, especializada em estratégias de investimento “inusitadas”.
O Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic (NANC) é um ETF que investe em ativos negociados por congressistas democratas (ou seus cônjuges), enquanto o Unusual Whales Subversive Republican (KRUZ) faz o mesmo, mas levando em conta os republicanos. Nos EUA, por lei, os investimentos de congressistas e seus parceiros ou parceiras são divulgados publicamente. Os ETFs, no entanto, não revelam quem investe nos ativos rastreados – não se sabe, portanto, o que está na carteiras de Trump e Biden.

Mas é possível distinguir setores preferidos dos dois lados do espectro político americano: de acordo com as carteiras dos fundos, os republicanos têm preferência pelos setores de petróleo e gás, enquanto democratas aplicam mais em empresas de tecnologia – o que ajuda a explicar a diferença de desempenho.
No NANC, dos democratas, estão entre os investimentos as ações de companhias como Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) e Alphabet (GOOG), que vêm de forte alta no ano passado, e que se destacaram na temporada de resultados do quarto trimestre. O produto também aloca em empresas de produção audiovisual, como Netflix (NFLX) e Walt Disney (DIS).
Já o KRUZ, dos republicanos, tem papéis do setor de energia, como Shell (SHEL) e Chevron (CVX). Em comum, democratas e republicanos investem na Amazon (AMZN).
ETFs inusitados
O mercado dos EUA tem mais de 3 mil ETFs, o que oferece uma “Disneylândia” para o investidor que segue à risca o mantra da diversificação. “Tem ETFs de tudo e é possível montar diferentes estratégias só com os fundos de índice, até as muito específicas”, diz Michael Viriato, professor e sócio da Casa do Investidor.
A popularidade dos ETFs nos EUA está ligada ao acesso facilitado (o valor mínimo para o primeiro aporte é inferior a US$ 10 em muitos casos) e cotas que são negociadas em Bolsa, garantindo liquidez. Dados da ICI (Investment Company Institute) mostram que o número de ETFs disponíveis nos Estados Unidos era de 3.152 ao final de janeiro. Essas carteiras totalizam ativos de US$ 8,1 trilhões, uma alta 17,5% em 12 meses.
Entre os fundos que navegam por temas exóticos, há por exemplo o Mental Health (SANE), que mira ativos de empresas atreladas ao tema da saúde mental e que tenham fluxo de caixa positivo. Já o Decarbonization (DKRB) investe em empresas de energia limpa, como as usinas eólicas.
Tem até ETF que investe apenas em empresas ligadas à cultura pop da Coreia do Sul, o Jakota K-Pop and Korean Entertainment (KPOP). Outro com estratégia no mínimo curiosa é o Inverse Cramer (SJIM), da Tuttle Capital Management: investir contra sugestões do apresentador de TV Jim Cramer.
Mas, ao contrário dos produtos que rastreiam investimentos dos políticos, vários possuem histórico negativo. O Inverse Cramer foi fechado no mês passado após acumular retorno negativo de 15% em dez meses depois de lançado. A mesma gestora possuía o Long Cramer (LJIM), que foi descontinuado em agosto do ano passado.
O ETF de K-Pop acumula perdas de 23,81% no acumulado de 12 meses, e o DKRB, de descarbonização, recuou 25,67% na mesma janela.
Confira o desempenho nos últimos 12 meses de 7 ETFs com temáticos com estratégias “curiosas”:

Article title:  Coup de mou chez Apple : AAPL atteint son plus bas niveau sur l'année

Article maintext:  Des ventes d’iPhone qui s’écroulent en Chine, un App Store probablement un peu moins rentable suite à la mise en place du DMA européen, une absence de communication claire sur les technologies d’IA (même si on voit bien que ça bosse dur en coulisses), un casque Apple Vision Pro qui ne fait pas l’unanimité malgré ses grandes qualités (comme toutes les V1 d’Apple du reste), l’abandon du projet Apple Car et enfin l’amende salée d’1,8 milliard d’euros en Europe, tous ces éléments mis bout-à-bout commencent à ressembler à une mini crise, ou tout au moins à un vrai coup de mou. Cette baisse générale de régime n’est pas passée inaperçue du côté des investisseurs, qui sanctionnent durement l’action AAPL depuis quelques semaines. Ce mercredi 6 mars, AAPL a même atteint son point le plus bas de l’année, à 170,12 dollars l’action (pour une capitalisation autour des 2800 milliards de dollars).
Des investisseurs inquiets sur les nouvelles sources de croissance chez Apple
D’une façon générale, les investisseurs ne semblent pas très optimistes concernant la capacité d’Apple a se créer de nouvelles sources de croissance : les ventes d’iPhone et d’Apple Watch tendance à stagner, les ventes d’iPad sont en souffrance depuis 2 ans, le Mac fait le yoyo, et seuls les services semblent en capacité de générer une croissance régulière à deux chiffres, une croissance qui risque d’être ralentie par le DMA européen. Enfin, et tout prometteur qu’il soit, l’Apple Vision Pro est encore trop loin de sa maturité pour gagner le coeur du grand public (sans même parler de son tarif prohibitif).
Les 2 milliards de dollars d’amende infligés à Apple par la Commission Européenne ont sans doute convaincu les investisseurs qu’il convenait d’être prudent. Alors certes, AAPL a chuté de 8,3% de puis le début de l’année, mais l’on parle ici de la seconde capitalisation boursière mondiale derrière Microsoft, et l’on n’assiste pas non plus à une fuite massive des actionnaires. Les investisseurs ayant tendance à être de belles girouettes qui suivent le vent du jour, ce moment baissier pourrait encore s’inverser avec la présentation d’iOS 18, surtout si les fonctions d’IA (attendues) sont au programme.

Article title:  Акции Apple продолжили падение: ИИ-компании оставляют ее позади

Article maintext:  Инвесторы обеспокоены будущим Apple по нескольким причинам. После года отрицательного роста выручки Apple на февральской конференции по прибыли предложила лишь ограниченные прогнозы роста. К тому же последние сообщения свидетельствуют о значительном снижении продаж iPhone в Китае, ключевом рынке для компании. Местные конкуренты, такие как Huawei, отвоевывают позиции. Недавний штраф ЕС в размере 2 миллиардов долларов за «незаконную» политику App Store еще больше подпортил настроение инвесторам, вызвав опасения относительно будущих препятствий в сфере регулирования.
Эти факторы способствовали падению акций AAPL на 8,3% в годовом исчислении и почти на 13% по сравнению с историческими максимумами.
Между тем, многие другие технологические гиганты демонстрируют положительную динамику акций, подпитываемые нынешним бумом ИИ. В этом году акции Microsoft выросли на 8,5%, а акции Nvidia, ведущего производителя ИИ-ускорителей, увеличились на 78%, почти сравнявшись с рыночным капиталом Apple.
Считается, что Apple отстает в гонке за ИИ, поскольку до сих пор не было сделано ни одного крупного анонса в этой области. Однако, по слухам, ситуация может измениться на июньской конференции WWDC, где в iOS 18 может появиться глубокая интеграция ИИ.

Article title:  After $200 billion selloff, Apple looks the most oversold in years

Article maintext:  Apple shares have struggled mightily in 2024, and the ongoing weakness has the stock looking like it is the most oversold in years, analysts say.
Ryan Vlastelica for Bloomberg News:
‎
Shares of the iPhone maker are down 14% from a recent peak and have dropped 12% this year, compared with a gain of 7.42% for the Nasdaq 100 Index. Apple shares have been pressured by concerns over iPhone sales in China and a fine from the European Union.
The stock fell 0.3% on Wednesday, its sixth straight negative session. The 7.2% decline over that six-day drop has erased more than $200 billion in market capitalization.
“At some point this hate is going to be too much, and most oversold in six years seems like a good place to start,” Michael Toomey, head of TMT trading at Jefferies LLC, wrote in a note to clients.
Jefferies looked at the relative strength index of long Apple positions versus short positions in the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, the exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100. Based on this, “this is the most oversold AAPL/QQQ has been since early 2018.”
Bespoke Investment Group LLC wrote in a post on X that Apple is more than three standard deviations below its 50-day moving average, and that “it hasn’t been this oversold since March 16th, 2020 in the throes of the COVID crash.”

Article title:  Better than 50% chance that Apple will acquire a major movie studio - analyst

Article maintext:  “There’s a lot of pressure for Apple to acquire a major studio,” Wedbush Securities Daniel Ives tells Variety. “I still think that it’s more than a 50% chance that they acquire one over the next 12 to 18 months.”
Tatiana Siegel for Variety:
‎
When it comes to Apple’s Hollywood ambitions, it’s all about spending big to win big.
On March 10, the tech giant has 13 shots to take home an Oscar via two historical epics, “Killers of the Flower Moon” and “Napoleon,” which nabbed 10 and three nominations, respectively. That’s given Apple the second-biggest haul among the major studios and streamers, just behind Netflix’s 18 nods and tied with Universal and Searchlight.
But at what price? Sources say the Martin Scorsese-helmed “Killers” cost an eye-popping $215 million (that includes about $40 million in Covid-related costs). In fact, Apple spent at least $700 million to make and market just three films: “Killers,” Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon” and Matthew Vaughn’s “Argylle.” The trio have earned a combined $466 million worldwide at the box office, with “Napoleon” leading the pack at $221 million, followed by “Killers” ($157 million) and “Argylle” ($88 million).
“The quality of the films has been extremely impressive and has attracted significant demand for the Apple TV+ service,” says Wedbush Securities’ Dan Ives. “But the Achilles’ heel is not the quality. They just don’t have enough [product]. I think that’s been the tug of war with Apple: They’ve achieved high quality and won Oscars, yet they lack the library in this content arms race.”

Article title:  台積電再奔768元新高價 市值衝上19.9兆元

Article maintext:  台積電 (2330-TW)(TSM-US) 被外資點名，將接獲更多英特爾 (INTC-US) 桌上型與筆電處理器訂單，在消息激勵下，昨日 ADR 強漲 4.89%，今 (7) 日在台股也啟動補漲，最高達 768 元新高價，市值衝上 19.9 兆元，也帶領台股再度締造新猷。
外資看好，英特爾下給台積電的訂單將在 2025 年出現顯著增長，並成為台積電 3 奈米製程的第二大客戶，僅次於蘋果 (AAPL-US)，看好英特爾的外包需求會降低客戶對英特爾自家代工的興趣，並進一步強化台積電的經濟規模優勢。
若從全球市值排名來看，目前微軟 (MSFT-US) 位居全球第一，市值逼近 3 兆美元，蘋果 (AAPL-US)、輝達 (NVDA-US) 分別位居第二、第三，市值約 2.61 兆美元、2.22 兆美元，而台積電位居全球第十，達 6280 億美元。
依據外資最新出具的報告顯示，台積電今年下半年成長將加速，全年 EPS 38.82 元，明年再進一步成長至 49.33 元，2026 年更會高達 57 元。

Article title:  Super Micro Computer Stock Hits New High Amid Optimism About AI-Related Growth

Article maintext:  Key Takeaways Shares of Super Micro Computer hit another record high on Wednesday amid ongoing investor optimism about the company's prospects for growth amid the AI boom.
Analysts at Argus Research said that "the company is primed for multiple years of strong top-line growth, margin expansion, and EPS acceleration," comparing its pattern to that of Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon. The firm gave the stock a buy rating and set its price target at $1,350.
Super Micro Computer shares gained 3.1% to finish Wednesday's session at $1,124.70. The stock has quadrupled since the start of 2024.
Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares closed at a new record high Wednesday amid growing optimism about the company's prospects for growth tied to booming demand for products and services tied to artificial intelligence.
The stock, which has quadrupled since the start of the year, gained 3.1% to finish the session at $1,124.70.
"Super Micro is a leading computer and server provider for the age of generative AI," Argus Research analysts wrote Wednesday, noting that "although SMCI has had huge gains in the past year, the company is primed for multiple years of strong top-line growth, margin expansion, and EPS acceleration."
The firm gave the stock a "buy" rating and set its 12-month price target at $1,350.
"Super Micro is emerging as a go-to provider for data center implementation of GPU Computing infrastructure used in training large language models (LLMs), inference, deep learning, and other elements that enable generative AI applications," the Argus analysts noted. "Repeating the pattern of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and most recently Nvidia (NVDA), Super Micro's revenues are growing much more rapidly than its costs, creating an environment for meaningful earnings growth," analysts added.
Super Micro Computer, which will join the S&P 500 this month, is partnered with semiconductor companies including Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which could mean the company is well positioned within the ecosystem powering AI leaders.

Article title:  Looking Ahead to Q1 Earnings: What's Next?

Article maintext:  Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>
Here are the key points:
Total S&P 500 earnings for the first quarter of 2024 are expected to be up +2.4% from the same period last year on +3.5% higher revenues. This follows the +6.7% earnings growth on +3.8% higher revenues in 2023 Q4.
As was the case in the preceding two quarters, the Tech sector remains a key growth driver in 2024 Q1. Had it not been for the robust Tech sector earnings growth, total earnings for the rest of the index would be modestly in negative territory.
The 2023 Q4 earnings season has not officially ended, as 7 S&P 500 member companies have yet to report quarterly results. For the 493 index members that have already reported Q4 results, total earnings are up +6.9% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues, with 75.3% beating EPS estimates and 64.1% beating revenue estimates.
For 2024 Q1, ‘Magnificent 7’ earnings are expected to increase +33.2% on +13.4% higher revenues. Excluding the Mag 7 contribution, 2024 Q1 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -3.3% from the year-earlier period (vs. +2.4% growth otherwise).
As we gear up for the March-quarter reporting cycle, whose early results will start coming out in the next few days, it is useful to summarize what we learned in the Q4 earnings season (only seven companies are still to report Q4 results at this stage).
While no major surprises emerged from the Q4 earnings season, the earnings and revenue growth pace showed modest acceleration from recent periods, and the tone and substance of management guidance remained largely favorable.
The Tech sector was a material contributor to the aggregate growth picture in Q4. The sector struggled in the post-COVID period, resuming its traditional growth-driver status just in 2023 Q3. This came after six consecutive quarters of underwhelming Tech sector earnings growth, starting in 2022 Q1 when the sector was a drag on the aggregate growth picture.
Story continues
Earnings growth for the S&P 500 index would have been modestly in negative territory on an ex-Tech basis.
The ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks – Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META, Nvidia NVDA & Tesla TSLA – were again significant contributors to growth in 2023 Q4. Please note that two of the ‘Mag 7’ stocks are not part of the Zacks Tech sector; these two are Amazon (part of the Zacks Retail sector) and Tesla (part of the Zacks Autos sector).
The chart below shows the quarterly earnings and revenue growth picture for the S&P 500 index.

Given the expected moderation in the U.S. economy’s growth trajectory due to the cumulative effects of Fed tightening, these estimates likely need to come down. But the +4.9% revenue growth expectation is hardly aggressive, considering that the U.S. economy produced a nominal GDP growth rate in excess of +6% last year.
The rest of the 2024 earnings growth is coming from margin expansion, with 2024 net margins for the index going up to +12.4% from last year’s 11.7%. Embedded in this margin expectation is the view that the inflation cycle has run its course, with easing cost pressures letting net margins return to the 2022 level.
We don’t see this margin (or revenue) outlook as unreasonable or out-of-sync with the economic ground reality.

Article title:  蘋果連跌6日 摜破170美元關卡 未來何去何從？進場時機到了？

Article maintext:  蘋果 (AAPL-US) 周三 (6 日) 再次走跌並跌破 170 美元關鍵水準，引起投資者臆測該股是否將觸底。
蘋果周三收低 0.59% 至每股 169.12 美元，為連續第六日下跌，同日標普 500 指數上漲 0.51%，納指上升 0.58%。今年迄今，蘋果股價已下跌 12%，落後納指約 18 個百分點。
Fairlead Strategies 創辦人兼市場技術員 Katie Stockton 表示：「蘋果已跌破 179 美元至 180 美元附近的支撐位，處於短期看跌的發展中。」
如此蘋果必須守住 170 美元的水準，倘若無法回到該水準之上，蘋果股價恐遭長期受挫，「下一個支撐點大約在 161 美元。」
Stockton 並非依據蘋果人工智慧計畫或新 iPhone 的銷售等做出基本面判斷，而是靠股價技術圖來分析該股短期和中期的走勢。股票的技術圖包含大量有關以下方面的信息：過去投資人認為股票有吸引力和吸引力下降的情況，以及投資者情緒發生重大變化的情況。
CappThesis 創始人 Frank Cappelleri 認為蘋果股票的支撐位約為 165 美元，與 Stockton 類似。
22V Research 技術策略主管 John Roque 今年 1 月時指出，蘋果的股票技術圖看起來走疲，稱蘋果相對於標準普爾 500 指數已經看跌，其交易價格是一年期相對低點，處於 2020 年 8 月首見的相對水準。
他在 2 月底跟進，對前景持悲觀態度，認為如果蘋果股價跌破 165 美元，將一路下探至 130 美元，即 2021 年的股價水準。
若跌至 130 美元，蘋果預估本益比將約 20，與標普 500 指數的本益比相仿。蘋果股票在 2019 年大部分時間哩，本益比約 20。
華爾街分析師認為，蘋果股票的平均目標價約為 200 美元，較近期股價隱含約 18% 漲幅。一年前華爾街對蘋果股票的目標價約為 170 美元，較當時約 155 美元的交易價隱含 10% 漲幅。
但倘若蘋果出現反彈漲勢，這不令人意外。傑富瑞 (Jefferies) 分析師 William Beavington 指出，自 2018 年以來，蘋果相對於 QQQ ETF 超賣程度是最嚴重的，多頭蘋果 / 空頭 QQQ 的 RSI（相對強弱指數的縮寫）為 16.7 。
「感覺上好像每天都能聽到不利蘋果股價的數據點，且蘋果股票不是特別便宜，但蘋果股票已連續 6 周落後納斯達克 100 指數 (NDX-US)，過去 12 周更有 11 周落後，處於 6 年來最嚴重的超賣，這似乎是個不錯的起點。」Beavington 寫道。

Article title:  macOS 14.4 SonomaやiPadOS 17.4の「Safari v17.4」では、お気に入りバーに表示されるWebサイトのFaviconとサイト名をFaviconのみの表示にすることが可能に。

Article maintext:  macOS 14.4 SonomaやiPadOS 17.4の「Safari v17.4」ではお気に入りバーに表示されるWebサイトのFaviconとサイト名を、Faviconのみの表示にすることが可能になっています。詳細は以下から。
Appleが2023年10月にリリースしたmacOS 14 SonomaやiPadOS 17同梱のデフォルトブラウザ「Safari v17」では、2018年にリリースされた「Safari v12」のタブバーに続き、お気に入りバーにもWebサイトのFaviconが表示できるようになりましたが、
macOS版のSafari v17はコンテキストメニューから、iPadOS版のSafari v17は設定アプリの[Safari]からFavicon(アイコン)表示が可能です。
Apple WebKitチームのJen Simmonsさんらによると、Appleが現地時間2024年03月05日にリリースしたiPadOS 17.4および近くリリース予定のmacOS 14.4 SonomaやmacOS 13 Ventura, macOS 12 Monterey向けの「Safari v14.4」では、お気に入りバーの表示をアイコンとテキスト表示, アイコンのみの表示(New), テキストのみの表示の3種類から選択できるようになっているそうです。
First, you can now configure the Favorites Bar to show your bookmarks with only their icons. Edit the name of the bookmark in the favorites bar, and remove the name. The icon will remain. WebKit Features in Safari 17.4 – WebKit Blog
この表示設定は、昨日リリースされたiPadOS 17.4に同梱されているSafari v17.4では、設定アプリの[Safari] → [お気に入りバーの外見]から設定可能で「アイコンのみを表示」を選択すると、
アドレスバー下に表示される、お気に入りバーのWebサイトからサイト名(テキスト)が消え、旧プラグイン拡張Favicon BarやSafariStandの様に、お気に入りバーをFaviconのみにすることができるので、iPadOS 17.4へアップデートされた方は試してみてください。

슈퍼 화요일 공화당 예비선거는 니키 헤일리의 대선 열망을 효과적으로 종식시켰습니다. 더 넓게 보면, 그 결과는 로널드 레이건의 정당이 이제 완전히 그리고 완전히 도널드 트럼프의 정당이 되었다는 것을 뜻합니다.
트럼프가 '해안에서 해안'으로 승리하면서 3연속 대통령 후보 지명을 눈앞에 두게 됐습니다. 트럼프는 2015년 그의 첫 대선 캠페인을 시작할 때, 특히 중국으로부터의 수입품에 대한 관세, 급격한 이민 제한과 고립주의적인 외교 정책을 옹호함으로써 공화당의 정통성에 도전했습니다.
그는 낙태와 동성 결혼과 같은 핫버튼 사회 문제를 강조하지 않았고, 보수적인 공화당 세대들이 삭감하려고 노력했던 자격 프로그램인 메디케어와 사회보장제도를 옹호했습니다. 기득권층의 많은 사람들이 회복되었지만, 트럼프가 당의 지위와 불만을 가진 유권자들에게 호소가 강력했습니다.
그것은 그가 후보가 되고 힐러리 클린턴에게 근소한 차이로 역전승을 거두었습니다. 화요일 결과에서 알 수 있듯이 트럼프의 공화당 충성도에 대한 해머락은 두 번의 탄핵, 의회 선거에서의 정당 패배, 2020년 조 바이든 대통령의 손에 패배를 했음에도 불구하고 견뎌왔습니다.
"2016년, 트럼프는 공화당에 적대적인 인수를 시작했습니다," 라고 그 해 '트럼프'의 주요 '선거 전략'가였던 스티브 배넌이 말했습니다. "그 인수는 이제 완료되었습니다." 공화당 여론조사기관들은 이제 러시아와의 대결, 세계에서 미국의 힘을 투사하는 것, 자유무역 등 레이건 시대 공화당의 중심이었던 문제들을 포함해 트럼프의 많은 입장들이 공화당 경선 유권자들의 시각에 반영되어 있다고 지적합니다. 이 정당의 레이건 시대로부터의 결별은 헤일리를 포함한 40대 대통령과 가장 밀접하게 일치하는 후보들의 저조한 성과에 의해 더욱 강조됩니다.

민주당원들은 미네소타의 모든 최고위직을 차지하고 있습니다. 공화당원은 이곳에서 12년 동안 주지사로 선출되지 않았고, 1972년 리처드 닉슨 이후로 대통령 선거에서 주 정부가 적자를 낸 적도 없습니다. 바이든 대통령은 미네소타에서 승리하기 위해 막대한 자원을 투입해서는 안 됩니다.

화요일의 조사 결과에 따르면, 2020년 이곳에서 바이든 대통령을 승리로 이끌었던 '연합이 약화'된 것으로 나타났습니다. 이 연합은 주로 그가 가자 전쟁을 처리한 것을 두고 이루어졌습니다. 즉, 선거에 방해가 될 만한 리스크는 끊김 없이 감정 없이 기계적으로 '싹 다 처 내야' 한다는 분석이 나옵니다.
'더불어재명당'은 대전 '박범계' 의원이 '밀렸다'는 것과 '무려 마포'에서 '오차 범위'라는 것에 '의미'가 '있는 것' 같습니다. 러시아 '푸틴'은 "'복수'가 천천히 식혀먹는 요리다"라고 하는데요. '더불어재명당'의 '개딸 경선'을 치른 친문·비명계는 '친명 자객'에 현역 '횡사의 밤'을 보냈습니다.
여기서 '끝이냐?' 그렇지 '않습니다'. '공천룰'을 '또 변경'을 했습니다. 더불어재명당을 '탈당'한 친문 좌장 홍영표 의원은 설훈 의원이 예고한 "민주연대"로 '세를 규합'해서 새로운미래와 합당으로 반공좌파 DJ와 노무현 리버럴 전통의 민주당이 사람 '잘못 들여' 사실상 분당 '수순'을 '밟게' 됐습니다.
송영길 전 '더불어재명당' 대표가 '소나무당'을 창당했습니다. 서울 종로구 노무현시민센터에서 열린 소나무당 창당대회는 옥중에 있는 송영길 전 '의원' 대신에 지지자와 민병덕 의원 등이 참석했습니다. 송영길 전 대표 측은 당명을 '소나무당'으로 정한 것에 대해 "남산 위의 소나무처럼 바람서리가 몰아쳐도 굴복하지 않고 검찰독재의 국정농단에 맞서 싸우겠다"라고 설명했습니다.

Article title:  ce n'est pas un iPhone)

Article maintext:  L’analyste spécialisé de TFI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo vient de lâcher une petite bombe dans le monde de la tech. Le premier écran pliant d’Apple verrait ainsi le jour d’ici peu, avec une production à grande échelle qui débuterait en 2027. Pour rappel, ce calendrier se rapproche aussi de la date d’arrivée supposée de nouveaux MacBook avec dalle OLED. D’ailleurs, pour notre source du jour, c’est en réalité un affichage de 20,3 pouces qui pourrait débarquer d’ici trois ans environ. Omdia, un cabinet d’études, avait déjà évoqué cette diagonale potentielle pas plus tard que le mois dernier. Nos confrères de chez iPhon.fr rapportaient ainsi l’information le 22 février, au sein de leurs colonnes.
Pour en revenir aux dires de Ming-Chi Kuo, sachez que ce dernier évoque ici le cas d’un MacBook. C’est donc cette gamme qui profiterait pour la première fois de la technologie d’écrans pliable d’Apple, que la société développe en interne depuis de nombreuses années (des brevets le prouvent aux États-Unis). En ce qui concerne l’iPad pliant ou l’iPhone flexible, hypothèse alternative au Pixel Fold de Google, aucun calendrier de sortie précis ne nous est en revanche parvenu pour l’instant. Il est donc possible que l’ordinateur portable voit le jour avant ces deux autres projets éventuels, qui ont aussi eu droit à leur lot de rumeurs par le passé.
À quoi va ressembler ce nouvel appareil ?
Dans les brevets déposés par Apple, justement, on peut apercevoir un ordinateur portable s’apparentant au design des MacBook Pro mais sans le moindre clavier physique à l’avant. À la place, le fabricant voudrait remplacer les touches à mécanisme à ciseaux par un grand écran tactile. Idem pour le trackpad, qui permet de se déplacer avec la souris au sein de l’interface de macOS. Le tout ferait alors office de diagonale unique avec l’affichage du système d’exploitation.
Autre document encore, toujours déposé auprès de l’USPTO, suggère qu’un iMac s’inspirerait de ce concept pour éviter de devoir être livré avec un Magic Keyboard à connecter en ou une Magic Mouse (souris sans fil d’Apple). Mais bien sûr, rappelons que de tels schémas ne nous permettent pas d’être assurés de la présentation de ce genre de produits. En effet, il n’est pas rare de voir Cupertino développer de nouvelles technologies qui, finalement, ne voient jamais le jour. La preuve avec la voiture connectée, électrique et autonome du projet Titan.
Ming-Chi Kuo n’en dit pas plus sur la date de sortie exacte de ce futur MacBook pliable. Sachez cependant que la production en masse débute environ six mois avant les premières précommandes des clients finaux. On peut donc imaginer qu’un ordinateur portable du genre sera présenté au grand public lors de la Worldwide Developer Conference, habituel grand rendez-vous de la firme à la pomme à destination des éditeurs et des journalistes. Pour une sortie en septembre, date à laquelle sont en général annoncés les iPhone haut de gamme et de nouveaux modèles d’Apple Watch.
Une source relativement fiable
Si nous relayons aujourd’hui les dires de l’analyste Ming-Chi Kuo, c’est car le Taïwanais a régulièrement vu juste par le passé (environ huit fois sur dix). De plus, ses prédictions sont suivies de près par de nombreux investisseurs ayant misé sur le titre AAPL à la bourse de Wall Street.
Aujourd’hui, ce dernier vaut environ 170 dollars à l’heure où nous écrivons ces lignes. Mais des estimations de chercheurs spécialisés laissent penser que le cours de l’action californienne pourrait atteindre jusqu’à 250 dollars d’ici la fin de l’année. Grâce, semble-t-il, aux performances de haut vol enregistrées par le lancement du casque de réalité mixte Apple Vision Pro. Mais pas que, car, rappelons-le, c’est aujourd’hui toujours l’iPhone qui rapporte le plus à Apple. En deuxième position de ses revenus les plus rémunérateurs, on retrouve les services, comme avec Apple Music, concurrent direct de Spotify et de Deezer en France métropolitaine.
Un MacBook pliant pourrait arriver en boutique fin 2027
L’iPhone pliant risque de sortir plus tard encore

Article title:  As 10 melhores ações internacionais para março: big techs dominam - mas há 4 “intrusas”

Article maintext:  Publicidade
O mês de fevereiro foi marcado pelo bom desempenho do S&P 500, principal indicador de ações de companhias de grande porte dos Estados Unidos, que rompeu sua máxima histórica, puxado principalmente pelos balanços das big techs.
Diante do cenário, não deu outra: entre sete casas consultadas pelo InfoMoney, seis têm pelo menos uma gigante da tecnologia na carteira de ações estrangeiras recomendada para março. No total, 65 companhias foram citadas – a reportagem selecionou as 10 mencionadas pelo menos duas vezes.
“De um modo geral, entendemos que a mesma tônica observada no primeiro mês de 2024 se manteve em fevereiro – ou seja, grande parte do forte retorno do S&P 500 ano passado (e no começo deste ano) foi concentrado nas grandes empresas americanas de tecnologia”, disse Daniel Martins, sócio e gestor de investimentos da GeoCapital.

Tese de investimento
Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) e Nvidia (NVDA) – que alcançou valor de mercado acima de US$ 2 trilhões após divulgar balanço positivo – receberam quatro recomendações das gestoras, apoiadas principalmente na tese da inteligência artificial.
Para Fernando Siqueira, head de research da Guide Investimentos, a Nvidia moldou a indústria tecnológica, influenciando áreas como gráficos de computador e IA, e continua a ser um grande impulsionador de inovação. “A Nvidia desbravou a aplicação das GPUs em inteligência artificial e aprendizado profundo, impulsionando avanços em campos como carros autônomos e diagnósticos médicos”, escreveu em relatório.
Já a tese para Alphabet está baseada em liderança no segmento de busca online; investimentos em ferramentas de IA e machine learning em seus principais produtos e serviços; e crescimento do segmento de computação na nuvem, dizem analistas do BTG Pactual.
No Santander, a Microsoft é considerada uma boa aposta porque a empresa “vem acelerando a transformação de negócio de venda tradicional de softwares para assinaturas, o que gera receitas mais recorrentes”, defendem os estrategistas de BDR do Santander, Guilherme Bellizzi Motta e Ricardo Peretti.
Sobre a Amazon, os analistas do Santander disseram que vale ter a companhia no portfólio por causa dos “negócios promissores e complementares à sua principal linha de receita com grande potencial de crescimento”, como streaming e computação em nuvem.
Das 10 principais escolhas para o mês, seis são do setor de tecnologia. Completam a lista o banco de investimento JPMorgan (JPM), a Visa (V), a gestora Berkshire Hathaway (BRK), do megainvestidor Warren Buffet, e a Coca-Cola (KO).
Veja a seguir as ações estrangeiras mais recomendadas para março:

Article title:  With VW Partnership And Progress With Self-Driving Tech, Is Xpeng Stock Undervalued At $9?

Article maintext:  A Xpeng G9 is displayed at a XPeng store in a mall in Beijing on February 29, 2024. (Photo by WANG ... [+] Zhao / AFP) (Photo by WANG ZHAO/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images
Chinese luxury electric vehicle maker Xpeng stock posted mixed delivery numbers for February, selling 4,545 EVs for the month, down 44.9% from January, and down 24% from the year-ago period. The decline was not really surprising, given that automotive sales in China are usually weak in January and February, due to the extended Chinese New Year holiday, which impacts manufacturing and sales. The holiday fell between February 10 and 17 this year, versus last year when it fell between January 21 and 27. In comparison, Nio delivered 8,132 cars for the month, down 19% from January and 33% lower from the year-ago period while Li Auto sold 20,251 cars, down 35% from January, although it marks an increase of about 22% compared to last year.
XPEV stock has suffered a sharp decline of 80% from levels of $45 in early January 2021 to around $9 now, vs. an increase of about 35% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the decrease in XPEV stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 18% in 2021, -80% in 2022, and 47% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that XPEV underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Consumer Discretionary sector including AMZN, TSLA, and TM, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could XPEV face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?
There are concerns about global EV demand, with most mainstream automakers seeing tepid demand and scaling back on their electrification goals. For instance, Mercedes-Benz dialed back on its target of going all-electric by 2030, now estimating that only 50% of total sales would be EVs. We’ve seen similar production scalebacks from the likes of Ford as well. While the Chinese EV market is poised to post double-digit growth this year, competition and price wars are mounting and this has been weighing on Xpeng. For Q3, the company posted its widest-ever net loss since going public, while its vehicle gross margins came in at negative 6.1%, down from 11.6% in the year-ago period. Last year, Xpeng announced plans to partner with Volkswagen to co-develop two mid-sized VW-branded EVs in a strategic partnership. Last week, the two companies indicated that the first vehicle they intend to develop together will be an SUV for which they will jointly source components. The move to source parts together could help Xpeng cut costs given that VW has been investing in bolstering its EV supply chain in recent years. VW was China’s best-selling car brand until 2022. Xpeng is also seen as a strong player in the self-driving software space. Last month, the company said that its XPeng navigation guided pilot feature which enables self-driving in several scenarios would be available across China, for use in all roads. The offering was initially available only for highway driving scenarios.

Article title:  Will Q4 Results Help Extend The 14% Gain In American Eagle Stock Since Beginning Of This Year?

American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE: AEO), which sells men’s and women’s apparel and accessories under the American Eagle, Tailgate, Todd Snyder, and Aerie brands, is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Thursday, March 7. We expect the stock to likely trade lower with both revenues and earnings missing market expectations in the upcoming fourth quarter results. The company’s Aerie brand has shown impressive growth despite the macroeconomic environment. While its namesake brand has struggled with tough comparisons to its post-pandemic recovery, its revenues grew 2% year-over-year (y-o-y) in the third quarter. American Eagle brand’s growth figure was still lower than what the company achieved in Q3 2019, but it had many more stores (940 stores) at that point than it does today (873). That said, it will be a noteworthy inflection point for the company if it sees another upturn in the American Eagle brand revenues in Q4 (after Q3). We expect the company stock to be pressured in the short term but the company’s social media activities, e-commerce growth, lack of debt, and focus on Aerie will likely give the business greater flexibility.
AEO stock has shown strong gains of 25% from levels of $20 in early January 2021 to around $24 now, vs. an increase of about 35% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the increase in AEO stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 26% in 2021, -45% in 2022, and 52% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that AEO underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Consumer Discretionary sector including AMZN, TSLA, and TM, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could AEO face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?
Our forecast indicates that American Eagle Outfitters AEO ’ valuation is around $20 per share, which is 17% lower than the current market price. Look at our interactive dashboard analysis of American Eagle Outfitters Earnings Preview: What To Expect in Q4? for more details.
AEO Earnings Estimates For FY2023Q4 Trefis
(1) Revenues expected to be slightly below consensus estimates
Trefis estimates AEO’s FQ4 2023 revenues to be $1.6 Bil, slightly below the consensus estimate. In Q3, the apparel retailer’s revenue grew 5% y-o-y to $1.3 billion. Aerie brand rose 12% y-o-y (with same-store sales up the same amount) to $393 million and the American Eagle core brand grew 2% y-o-y (same growth here as well for comp store sales) to $857 million in Q3. In addition, AEO’s store revenue was 3% higher, and digital revenue was up 10%. The retailer’s gross margin has increased to 39.4% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 35% in FY’22. This margin expansion was driven by strong demand, lower product, and freight costs, and continued benefits from the lower markdowns and leverage on distribution, rent, and delivery.
For full-year FY 2023, the retailer’s management expects revenue to be up mid-single-digits y-o-y, compared to prior guidance for revenue up low single-digits. Operating income is expected to be between $340 to $350 million, at the high end of prior guidance of $325 to $350 million.
(2) EPS likely to miss consensus estimates
AEO’s FQ4 2023 earnings per share is expected to be 46 cents per Trefis analysis, missing the consensus estimate. In Q3, AEO’s adjusted earnings came in at $0.49 per share, up 16.7% y-o-y.
(3) Stock price estimate lower than the current market price
Going by our American Eagle Outfitters’ Valuation, with an EPS estimate of around $1.34 and a P/E multiple of 14.6x in fiscal 2023, this translates into a price of around $20, which is almost 17% lower than the current market price.

Article title:  13- and 15-inch MacBook Air with M3 review: Apple’s best gets better

Article maintext:  Since Apple’s (AAPL) entry into making its own chips, it’s safe to say that the MacBook Air has been taken to another level. It started with the iconic wedge design of the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1 and then evolved into a more modern design with the 13-inch — and later the 15-inch — MacBook Air with M2, setting up Apple’s most popular laptop for the future.

Article maintext:  [FTNN新聞網]記者馮茵／台北報導
美股旺到擋都擋不住！由於聯準會（FED）主席鮑爾周四「放鴿」，加上人工智慧熱潮不退，AI晶片龍頭輝達狂噴帶動美股四大指數周四開趴，其中那斯達克勁揚超過240點；費半更飆破3.3%，包括那指、費半、標普再刷歷史紀錄。個股方面，美股七雄普遍收漲，尤其以輝達最猛，暴漲4.4%突破900美元，寫下926美元的新天價；台積電ADR也上炸超過5%。

繼周三出席眾議院聽證會後，聯準會主席鮑爾（Jerome Powell）周四在參議院銀行委員會會議上表示，聯準會距離通膨率下降至 2% 的目標不遠，這將使降息成為可能。
經濟數據方面，美國周四公布上週初請失業金人數，21.7萬人與上週持平，隨著勞動市場狀況持續逐步緩解，一月職缺減少2.6萬個，招募人數減少。緊接著周五要揭曉的是非農就業報告。
由於鮑爾釋出「鴿派訊號」，投資人看到通膨緩解訊號，加上人工智慧題材炙手可熱，美股四大指數周四無極限的續噴，尤其科技股走勢最強，終場道瓊指數上漲130.30點，收38,791.35點，漲幅0.34%；標普上漲52.60點，收5,157.36點，漲幅1.03%；那斯達克上漲241.83點，收16,273.38點，漲幅1.51%；費半上漲167.90點，收5,165.83點，漲幅3.36%。其中那指、標普和費半皆再創歷史新高。
美股七雄方面，輝達（NVDA-US）已經不知怎麼跌了，再飆4.47%，突破900美元大關，來到926.69美元，寫下新天價；微軟（MSFT-US）上漲1.75%；臉書母公司Meta（META-US）上漲3.25%；谷歌母公司Alphabet（GOOGL-US）上漲2.02 %；亞馬遜（AMZN-US）上漲1.91%；特斯拉（TSLA-US）上漲1.20%；蘋果（AAPL-US）獨憔悴，下跌0.07%。
晶片股普遍收漲，英特爾（INTC-US）上漲3.68%；超微（AMD-US）上漲0.36%；博通（AVGO-US）上漲4.22%；高通（QCOM-US）上漲4.66%；美光（MU-US）上漲3.58%。
台廠ADR表現方面，台積電上漲7.63美元，收149.20美元，漲幅5.39%；聯電上漲0.34美元，收8.25美元，漲幅4.30%；鴻海上漲0.10美元，收6.77美元，漲幅1.52%

Article title:  Apple, Meta, Google, and Others Must Now Comply With New Law as EU Takes Aim at Big Tech

Article maintext:  Key Takeaways Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and TikTok owner ByteDance must now comply with the European Union's new law meant to break up big tech's dominance in the digital market.
The Digital Markets Act (DMA) named the six companies as "gatekeepers" in September of 2023 and granted them six months to comply with the Commission's requirements with the deadline falling on March 6.
The Commission said that Booking and X (formerly Twitter) could be the next companies to face strict regulation under the DMA.
Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and TikTok have announced changes for European users focused on enabling third-party interoperation on gatekeeper systems, additional data protections, and more choices for users, among other things.
Apple (AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and TikTok owner ByteDance must now fully comply with the European Union's (EU) new rules aimed to break up the control of a few big tech players in the digital market.
Under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), the six tech companies were designated "gatekeepers" in September of 2023 and granted six months to meet the requirements of the law or face fines of up to 10% of their annual worldwide turnover. The changes will affect users in the EU.
The European Commission recently reported that it received notifications from Booking Holdings (BKNG) and Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) that their services may meet the DMA "gatekeeper" threshold and therefore could be subject to further regulation. The Commission said it would take 45 working days to decide whether to classify the companies as gatekeepers after the notification on March 1.
The EU said that companies operating a "so-called core platform service" with at least 45 million monthly users and 10,000 annual business users, as well as a significant impact on the market and a stable market position, qualify for consideration.
Apple
Apple announced changes to the App Store, Safari, and the iOS operating system on iPhones as well as Apple Pay ahead of the March 6 deadline. The changes to the company's systems largely revolved around allowing third-party applications to interoperate on Apple systems.
The EU recently fined Apple nearly $2 billion (1.8 billion euros) for "abusive App store rules for music streaming providers" that the European Commission said violates EU antitrust laws. Apple said it intends to appeal the EU's decision, which it claims bolsters the already dominant position of Swedish company Spotify (SPOT).
Google
Google rolled out changes for users and app developers affecting Google services including search, Google Chrome browser, and the Google Play app store, among other features.
These updates could make it easier to download third-party apps, use other app stores, and access alternative billing options outside of Google Play. The changes will also make it more accessible for Google users to run external apps and services and protect user data.
Google's changes to comply with the DMA have come under fire from several travel companies claiming they could reinforce Google's leadership rather than make the digital marketplace more competitive.
Amazon
Amazon introduced several changes for EU users including requests to share personal information and data, bolstered ad transparency efforts, and new reports for advertisers.
The e-commerce giant has previously made changes to its offering in the EU. In 2023, the company launched a separate cloud in Europe to comply with EU privacy standards.
Meta
Meta introduced changes to Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp to allow users more choices on its platforms.
With the DMA-compliant changes, third-party messaging services will be able to interoperate with Messenger and WhatsApp.
Users in the EU will have the choice of whether to connect their accounts across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Facebook Marketplace, and Facebook Gaming. The users can also opt to use Facebook and Instagram ad-free through a paid subscription.
Microsoft
Microsoft announced changes to Windows and LinkedIn to comply with DMA requirements.
Updated versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11 are available for users in the EU to download. The company reported that it will roll out the automatic installation of the update so that all affected users will have a DMA-compliant version by early April.
The changes to Windows included a redesign so users can uninstall the Edge browser and the Bing search function, and enabled third-party search engines to operate in Windows systems. Users will now have the opportunity to decide whether to connect accounts across Microsoft services rather than being automatically signed in.
Microsoft reported that it added more robust data handling standards and revamped the data content forms that Windows users see.
LinkedIn users in the EU will be able to decide whether to connect their core LinkedIn professional networking experience across offerings for jobs, marketing solutions, and LinkedIn Learning, as well as additional access to data collected by the platform.
ByteDance's TikTok
TikTok reported improvements to the "download data" feature for users and developers as well as providing business accounts with additional access to data as a part of changes the platform made to comply with the EU rules.
The platform, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has been working to appeal its "gatekeeper" designation since November of 2023.
The company said that while it "fully support[s] the principles of the DMA, which aims to better enable challengers to compete with incumbent players," it holds "the belief that [its] designation risks undermining the DMA's own stated goal by protecting actual gatekeepers from newer competitors like TikTok."

Article title:  Nvidia's $1 Trillion Market Cap Gain This Year Is Nearly Double Tesla's Entire Market Cap

Article maintext:  Key Takeaways Nvidia shares rose more than 4% on Thursday, bringing its market capitalization to more than $2.28 trillion, an increase of over $1 trillion from its value at the beginning of the year.
The stock has surged in the last year and a half amid a boom in demand for its graphics processing units, which are instrumental in training and running artificial intelligence.
Nvidia's rise contrasts with the fortunes of Magnificent Seven peers Tesla and Apple, shares of which have fallen this year amid concerns about an absence of growth catalysts and slowing sales in China.
Just 67 days into 2024, Nvidia (NVDA) has already added more than $1 trillion in market value.
Shares rose more than 4% to $926 on Thursday as Mizuho Securities raised its price target 17% to $1,000. Thursday's gains brought Nvidia's market cap to $2.28 trillion, up from $1.22 trillion at the end of 2023.
The chip maker’s stock has soared in the last year and a half amid a boom in demand for artificial intelligence and the Nvidia graphics processing units on which it is so often trained and operated.
Just this year, Nvidia shares have risen more than 85%. The company added a record $272 billion in market value in a single day in February after its earnings topped Wall Street’s high expectations.
Nvidia’s meteoric rise stands in stark contrast to the recent fortunes of some of its Magnificent Seven peers, specifically Tesla (TSLA) and Apple (AAPL).
Tesla has struggled with a slowdown in electric vehicle demand and increased competition in major markets like China, both of which have forced manufacturers to slash prices. Shares have fallen nearly 25% this year, erasing more than $225 billion from Tesla's market cap, which now stands at $562 billion.
Apple has also fallen victim to a slowdown in China, where iPhone sales so far this year have disappointed. The company also recently pulled the plug on an electric vehicle initiative and has struggled to convince investors its newest product, the Apple Vision Pro augmented reality headset, can become a best-selling, category-defining product like the iPhone and iPad. Apple shares have lost about 12% so far this year, which has trimmed more than $380 billion from its market cap, which was once the largest in the world at more than $3 trillion.
(Update—March 7, 2024: This story was updated to reflect Nvidia's share price at the close on Thursday.)

Article title:  Overview: Where Gurus Found Value in the 4th Quarter

Article maintext:  With the latest round of 13F filings released over the past month, investors and market watchers alike are interested in seeing where the major hedge fund managers are finding value opportunities.
Background
Managers with more than $100 million in assets under management are required to disclose their holdings to the SEC each quarter via 13F filings. These filings are due 45 days after the quarter end date. For fourth-quarter 2023, that means managers must disclose all qualifying assets held on Dec. 31, 2023 by Feb. 15, 2024. Qualifying assets include long positions in U.S. equities and ADRs, call/put options and convertible debt securities. Shorts, cash positions, foreign investments and other assets are not included.
Investors can take advantage of these 13F filings to create portfolios from managers that have proven past success. Despite the 45-day delay in reporting, research has shown that investing alongside a single manager or group of managers can outperform the market. The key is to identify the best and most consistent funds to copy.
The statistics in this report are based on our Premium gurus. These gurus are our hand-picked, best-performing value investors that have proven long-term records.
Tech winners make up the Aggregated Portfolio
The GuruFocusAggregated Portfolio, a Premium feature based on these managers' quarterly filings, shows the 10 most broadly held stocks as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 included some Magnificent Seven names that were also popular in the previous quarter, such as software giant Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Ticker Company No. of Guru Owners No. of Buys No. of Sells MSFT Microsoft Corp. 59 11 43 GOOGL Alphabet Inc. 54 14 34 META Meta Platforms Inc. 51 20 30 AMZN Amazon.com Inc. 46 18 25 BRK.B Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 37 9 22 UNH UnitedHealth Group Inc. 36 13 20 BAC Bank of America Corp. 34 15 16 CMCSA Comcast Corp. 34 8 19 AAPL Apple Inc. 33 10 20 WFC Wells Fargo & Co. 32 5 24
Other big names among Guru Hot Picks
While these stocks are quite popular overall, they did not all necessarily see the heaviest guru buying activity during the three months ended Dec. 31. According to GuruFocusHot Picks, that honor only goes to a handful of companies, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Elevance Health Inc. (NYSE:ELV) and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C). However, several of these 10 companies also recorded a lot of selling activity over the same period.

Consensus Picks contain a mix of stocks
Then there are those stocks that were bought by at least two gurus during the quarter, but did not record any sells. GuruFocusConsensus Picks shows these companies included names like John Wiley & Sons Inc. (NYSE:WLY) and Orla Mining Ltd. (ORLA).

A brief look at selling activity
On the sell side, GuruFocus Hot Picks found investors were shedding shares of a number of companies as well. While Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) and VMware Inc. (VMW), among several other stocks, are listed, they were not necessarily sold. Rather, these companies were acquired or merged with other companies and, therefore, are recorded as a sale in our database. As such, Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) actually recorded the largest number of sell transactions for the period.

Analysis of Industry Trends
As for gurus' investments within individual sectors, the GuruFocusIndustry Trends page shows the heaviest buying occurred in the software industry, driven by the recent craze for artificial intelligence technology. However, several other industries saw good numbers as well.

Overview: Where Gurus Found Value in the 4th Quarter
During the quarter, a number of well-known gurus were also making large bets ininternational companies by either entering new positions or expanding their existing holdings. For example, Fairfax's Prem Watsa (Trades, Portfolio) boosted his stake in Canada's Orla Mining. Spain's Azvalor also established holdings in Endeavour Mining PLC (TSX:EDV) (LSE:EDV) and Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) for two of its funds.
